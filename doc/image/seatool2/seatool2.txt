Welcome to Seagate's SeaTools for DOS Software!
This User Guide file contains important information about SeaTools. Please read
this entire file before
using this software.
SeaTools for DOS is a comprehensive, easy-to-use diagnostic tool that helps you
quickly determine what
is preventing you from accessing data on your desktop or notebook computer. It
includes several tests
that will examine the physical media on your Seagate or Maxtor disk drive and
any non-Seagate disk
drive.

1. Why Use SeaTools?
After testing, a large percentage of the drives returned to Seagate for
warranty replacement are perfectly
good drives with "No Problem Found" (NPF). Returning a drive for warranty
service means system
downtime and inconvenience for you in packing and returning your drive product.
Before you send in a
drive, it is in your best interest to determine if a replacement drive is
really necessary. This hard disk
diagnostic utility will help you make that determination and possibly save you
time and money and
preserve your data.
Some typical reasons for No Problem Found are:
* File System Corruption
* Driver Corruption
* Broken Master Boot Record
* Virus and Trojan Attack
* Spyware, Adware and Keystroke loggers
* Hardware Conflicts
The Seagate SeaTools software is easy to load and simple to use. The following
instructions will help you
get the most out of this new software tool. If you have questions about this or
any other Seagate software
or service products, please contact your system supplier.
2. Using SeaTools
Do not remove the SeaTools CD while the tests are running.
Run Seagate SeaTools
====================
A. Reboot your system
Insert the SeaTools CD and reboot or power on your computer. The system will
boot to the FreeDOS
operating system. If your system fails to boot, see the Troubleshooting section
#5 later in this file.
B. Select Drives to Test
After SeaTools loads, the Drive List will show the different storage devices in
your system. The first drive
detected will be described as Device 0.
Select the drive you would like to test. Make sure to choose the correct drive!
A check mark in the Model
ID column will indicate which drive is selected.
This screen also displays information about the drives such as the Model Number
and Serial Number.
Seagate model numbers begin with the letters "ST".  Seagate serial numbers are
alpha numeric and eight
characters long.
Language selection is available:
C. Select the Tests to Run
A menu of the possible diagnostic tests is shown.  Select the tests that you
would like to perform.
Basic Tests  Advanced Features  Help
Short Test   Set Capacity   Contents
Long Test   Erase Drive   License
Acoustic Test     About
When you launch the "SHORT Test" most drives will run Drive Self Test. Drive
Self Test (DST) is a
thorough diagnostic routine that is built in to the hard drive's firmware.
Firmware is the machine language
programming the controls the disk drive. DST is completely data safe.
Older drives that do not support the DST will run a Legacy test which emulates
the DST.
Note: You can force SeaTools to run the legacy test by adding the command line
switch /L after
seatools.exe.
The "SHORT Test" is adequate for most situations. Consider running the "LONG
Test" which reads each
sector on the drive if you need to run a more comprehensive test.
The "LONG Test" test will take a long time to complete. Because the "LONG Test"
reads every sector on
the drive, the amount of time required will depend on the speed and capacity of
the disk drive. The
highest capacity drives often take 2 to 3 hours to complete. At any time, feel
free to Cancel the test
without harming the drive. The "LONG Test" will collect information about
possible defects. If any defect
are found, a list will be offered at the end or after aborting the scan. You
will have the opportunity to
attempt to repair the problem sectors.
D. Running of the Diagnostics
The SeaTools performs a data-safe test of the selected hard disk drive or
device for possible
malfunctions. Long tests may be aborted at any time.  Press the ESC (escape
key) from the keyboard.
During the "LONG Test" only, bad sectors (LBAs) may be detected. They could be
part of a data file or
even part of the operating system directory structure. Sometimes, problem
sectors are empty or not in
use. It is important to know that when the sector is bad and unreadable then
any data in it is already lost.
See section 4 "Help Topic: Bad Sector Found" for more information on this
topic.
E. Test Information and Results
Upon completion of running the diagnostics, the test results will be given. A
log for each drive is saved to
the RAM drive.
The following conditions may apply:
- Passed
- Passed after Repair (Seagate and Maxtor only)
- Failed
- User Skipped Repairs
- Aborted
"Passed after Repair" is a special condition where bad sectors were detected as
unreadable and the user
gave permission to SeaTools to attempt to reallocate blank replacement sectors
which was successful.
The drive is now considered a good drive. A few defects are usually not a cause
for concern. For
example, there are nearly four hundred million sectors on a 200GB drive.
Nonetheless, you should run
the LONG Test more often to see if there is a trend of growing defects.
"SeaTools Test Code" - When SeaTools for DOS determines that a drive has failed
a valid warranty test,
it will display a SeaTools Test Code. Please save this code if you are planning
a warranty exchange.
Seagate product warranty status depends on how the product is sold. If your
hard drive is a component
in an OEM system, then the OEM covers the drive warranty.
SeaTools Test Codes are based on the type of test that failed and the product
serial number. No two
codes are the same. The online RMA submission system will use the SeaTools Test
Code number to help
process the exchange of your product. The code tells Seagate that the drive is,
in fact, bad and that there
is virtually no chance that a good drive is being returned.
When you submit a drive for return to Seagate through the online Warranty and
Returns process, the
form will ask for your Serial Number, Model Number and SeaTools Test Code.
F. Set Capacity
Occasionally, a disk drive may be too large and its size needs to be reduced to
a lower capacity. Similarly,
a drive with a reduced capacity may need to be reset to its native maximum
capacity. Three choices are
available under this section: Set 32GB Capacity. A common setting for older
systems. Set Capacity to
MAX Native. Full capacity is restored. Set Capacity Manually. Allows you to set
a specific size.
G. Erase Drive
ZERO FILL DATA PATTERN WRITING IS A DATA DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION EQUIVALENT TO
ERASING THE DATA OFF THE DRIVE.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data. Erase Drive is available for
Seagate or Maxtor drives only.
Four choices are available under this section:
â¢  Erase Track 0. Use this to clear out an old operating system installation.
Very quick.
â¢  Zero ALL. This command writes zeros to every sector on the hard drive.
This test may take
several hours to complete.
â¢  Timed Fill. Using the time value set under the T selection, the drive will
erase sectors for that
time duration. Set the number of seconds to run. Press T to raise the number.
â¢  FDE Crypto Erase. If the drive is a Full Disk Encryption model disk drive,
then this option will be
available. You must be able to supply the appropriate password or SID (printed
on the drive's top
label) to begin the cryptographic erase.
You must type YES to confirm erasing the drive.
A "Defective drive" can often be revived with a data-destructive zero fill data
pattern or a low level format.
This is because today's modern disk drives contain thousands of spare sectors
which are automatically
reallocated if the drive senses difficulty reading or writing. Since SeaTools
is read- only (data safe)
occasionally a drive with many problem sectors that have not reallocated to a
spare sectors can be forced
to do so by writing to the sectors. Spare sector reallocation is a normal
intelligent drive operation.
See section 4 "Help Topic: Bad Sector Found" for more information on this
topic.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.
H. Acoustic Test
Sometimes a defective hard drive makes unusual noise. However, often the power
supply or CPU fans
are mistaken for the hard drive. This test will spin down the drive just like a
power management idle
condition. If the drive was the source of the noise then the sound will stop.
If the noise continues, you
can eliminate the hard drive as the source.
I. View Log
Test results are saved in a log file with a file name based on the drive serial
number. This report can be
saved to a floppy disk or printed.
**** NOTE ****
After exiting SeaTools, if not saved to a floppy, this report will be on the
RAM drive until the system is
rebooted. If you booted from a CD then the floppy drive is usually B:\. Some
systems do not have any
floppy diskette drive. Unfortunately, in this case it may be difficult saving
the test log files. Some
suggestions on using a USB storage device for log files are given in the
Troubleshooting section #5 below
(topic: CANNOT SAVE or PRINT LOG FILES).
**** NOTE ****
If your printer attaches to the computer through the USB port then you will not
be able to print in DOS
applications. Printing from SeaTools is supported when the printer is attached
to the parallel printer port
(LPT1).
I. Quit
To exit the program, select "Exit" from the main menu. Press [CTRL]-[ALT]-[DEL]
to reboot, or power off
your system.
3. Error Codes
SeaTools for DOS may display a variety of error codes depending on the
interface and which test module
was running when the error or status occurred. In some situations when the
drive is offline running a
Drive Self Test, the drive gives its own DST result code.
Drive Self Test (DST) is a thorough diagnostic routine that is built in to the
hard drive's firmware.
Firmware is the machine language programming the controls the disk drive. DST
is completely data safe.
SMART (Self Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) is also built in to
the firmware and these
errors provide advanced warning about developing problems - such as excessive
retries while reading
data. A SMART error is a prediction of possible drive failure in the future. Be
sure to back up your data
regularly.
When a drive is completely non-functional, no make, model or error codes are
available.
Beginning with the most common error codes (these codes may display briefly on
the screen during the
test):
ATA Drive Self Test (DST)
Self-test execution status values:
0h The previous self-test routine completed without error or no self-test has
ever been run
1h The self-test routine was aborted by the host
2h The self-test routine was interrupted by the host with a hardware or
software reset
3h A fatal error or unknown test error occurred while the device was executing
its self-test routine and
the device was unable to complete the self-test routine.
4h The previous self-test completed having a test element that failed and the
test element that failed is
not known.
5h The previous self-test completed having the electrical element of the test
failed.
6h The previous self-test completed having the servo (and/or seek) test element
of the test failed.
7h The previous self-test completed having the read element of the test failed.
Log file says: DST -
Errors - Status: 07
Off-line data collection status byte values:
01h Reserved
02h or 82h Off-line data collection activity was completed without error.
03h Reserved
04h or 84h Off-line data collection activity was suspended by an interrupting
command from host.
05h or 85h Off-line data collection activity was aborted by an interrupting
command from host.
06h or 86h Off-line data collection activity was aborted by the device with a
fatal error.
4. Help Topic: "Bad Sector Found"
IMPORTANT:
Please read and carefully consider all of the following information about your
"Bad Sector Found" options.
A bad sector is a small area on the disk drive that is reporting errors and
cannot be accessed properly.
New bad sectors, sometimes called grown defects, are often caused by some kind
of physical damage. If
a file or folder uses this sector, then the file is already incomplete or
corrupt because the bytes are not
readable.
**** NOTE ****
The following information applies only to Seagate Technology or Maxtor brand
disk drives:
When SeaTools discovers a bad sector through reading, at the end of the scan it
displays a list of the bad
sectors.
If a sector is in use, then that file is incomplete or corrupt. When a bad
sector happens to align with a
folder or directory listing structure, then the links to files and sub-folders
it manages may be broken.
Sectors are often not in use.
You should carefully consider the importance of your data. While the sector is
currently unreadable, if the
file or folder is important to you then you may need professional recovery
services to possibly reclaim the
data. In this case, select NO to exit without trying to reallocate blank
replacement sectors on the drive.
If you have decided that the file or folder is replaceable, already backed up
or just not important to you,
then you can tell SeaTools to attempt to overwrite the sector.
By design, modern disk drives maintain spare sectors for reallocation purposes.
Usually, sectors become
difficult to read long before they become impossible to read. In this situation
the actual data bytes in the
sector are preserved and transferred to the new spare during a sector
reallocation. Similarly, when a disk
drive writes data and encounters a problem, the drive firmware retires the
problem sector and activates a
replacement before giving successful write status.
If you give permission to overwrite a bad sector SeaTools will attempt to write
a pattern of zeros to that
sector. Usually, this action will assist the disk drive firmware in managing
the problem by retiring the
problem LBA and activating a spare in its place.
Note: Seagate Technology is not responsible for lost user data.
5. Troubleshooting
DRIVE NOT DETECTED
- Understandably, a dead drive cannot communicate with the system or software
and will not be detected.
A drive with damaged electronics may have the appearance of running but be
broken in the ability to
communicate with the system. Either of these cases is a failed drive.
- One of the most common reasons for a new drive to not be detected is with the
setup of the cables and
jumpers, if any. Another common area is with the system BIOS setup. The drive
needs to be set to ON
in the BIOS, this is especially true when adding a second drive. Be sure to
double check if these items
are correct.
- Occasionally, a working drive will not be detected by the software. Disk
drives attach to the computer
through a section of circuitry on the motherboard called a controller. The
software is designed to be as
up-to-date as possible with known controllers. The drive is not by detectable
in this case because of an
unknown controller.
SeaTools WILL NOT LOAD
- If when you insert the SeaTools CD and power on the computer, it does not
load SeaTools, the "boot
sequence" may be set to boot to the hard disk drive first.
To change the boot sequence to boot from the CD drive first, you must enter the
"Setup" or "CMOS
Setup" of your computer. Methods for entering the Setup or CMOS Setup vary
depending on your
computer's make and model, but most methods consist of pressing a key or key
sequence during the
initial power on boot sequence.
Watch the screen closely during boot up for a message like "Press F2 to enter
Setup" or something
similar to determine which key or key sequence to press for your computer.
Nearly all systems will
continue on automatically after a brief period of time if the key is not
pressed, so act quickly. You may
have only a few seconds to find and press the appropriate key or key sequence.
The most common keys or key sequences to enter setup are:
- [F2]
- [DELETE]
- [F1]
- [CTRL]-[ALT]-[S]
- [CTRL]-[ALT]-[ESC]
- [CTRL]-[ALT]-[ENTER]
NOTE: Some computers that use the "[CTRL]-[ALT]-[___]" sequences must be at a
prompt before
pressing the keys. If you are unsure about how to enter the setup, see the
owner's manual for your
computer or seek assistance from your computer manufacturer or the store where
you purchased the
computer.
CD ROM WILL NOT BOOT
- Booting to a CD requires that the system BIOS is compatible with the
operating system on the CD. In
rare cases that seem tied to older system.This indicates an incompatibility
with the boot CD. In this
situation, the solution is to use the SeaTools v2.18 boot floppy diskettes
instead of the boot CD. Contact
Seagate Technical Support for a copy of this earlier version.
CANNOT SAVE or PRINT LOG FILES
- Many systems no longer have floppy diskette drives. This makes it difficult
to save the test results log
files. Similarly, systems usually have a USB printer which only prints from
Windows. This eliminates
printing in DOS.
One possible solution for both of these conditions, only on systems with the
right SETUP options, is to
attach a USB Storage Device to the system. The SETUP options must support
booting to a USB Storage
Device. Two examples if systems with USB support:
-->>Dell Optiplex GX270 example
when booting you see in the upper RH corner:
F2 = Setup
F12 = Boot Menu
When you press F2 you can set up the following order:
Hard Disk Drive Sequence
 1. USB device
 2. System BIOS boot devices
Boot Sequence (BIOS devices)
 1. Diskette Drive
 2. IDE CD-ROM Device
 3. Hard-Disk Drive C:
-->>Dell Inspiron 1150 example:
when booting you see in the upper RH corner:
F2 = Setup
F12 = Boot Menu
When you press F2 on Setup Page 2 you can set up the
following order:
***** Boot Order *****
 Diskette Drive
 USB Storage Device
 CD/DVD/CD-RW Drive
 Internal HDD
With both of these system examples, the requirement is to put the USB device
ahead of the CD which
itself should be ahead of the Hard Disk Drive (HDD). Your choice of USB storage
device opens a wide
range of alternatives. The simplest and least expensive are the USB Flash
Drives. USB external hard
drives are another possibility. However in some cases the system BIOS may have
compatibility problems
with large hard drives and no problems with Flash devices.
Put in the SeaTools bootable CD and plug in a USB storage device. Reboot. With
the order set above,
the system will attempt to boot from the USB device first but cannot since
there is no operating system on
it. After that it looks to the BIOS and sees the IDE CD- ROM Device where it
boots into SeaTools. If the
USB device was detected it will be mounted as a (non-booting, assuming FAT) C:
where we can save the
log files.
After you run SeaTools, exit and copy *.log to C: and you have just saved the
logs without using a floppy.
If your RAM drive is shown as C: then the SETUP does not support USB storage in
DOS. The file system
on the USB device must be either FAT16 or FAT32. DOS does not recognize NTFS.

A. Seagate Disk Drive Return Procedure
Seagate offers comprehensive worldwide customer support for all Seagate disk
drives both online and
through our regional Seagate Customer Service Centers and Authorized Service
Providers (see "Seagate
Technology Support Services" section, above). Drive return procedures can vary
by geographical location
and are subject to current International Trade Regulations.
1. Before you return a disk for warranty service, verify whether a replacement
drive is necessary to solve
the problem you are experiencing. If so, contact your place of purchase; if
they have an exchange policy,
it may be your most convenient solution.
2. Read the appropriate Seagate Warranty Statement for new or replacement
products (see "Service
Warranty Terms" section, below).
3. Know your Seagate product model number and serial number. See the label on
the top of the drive.
4. Verify the warranty status of the drive you wish to return. If the product
is still under warranty, obtain an
RMA (step 5). If the warranty is expired, contact a local service facility, a
Seagate Service Center
Representative, or an Authorized Service Provider. If Seagate records indicate
that the warranty is
expired and you believe this is incorrect, contact your place of purchase or a
Seagate Service Center
Representative.
5. Obtain an RMA. To obtain an RMA online, use the Warranty Validation
application at
www.seagate.com/support. It will lead you into the RMA request application. To
obtain an RMA by phone
or fax, contact an Authorized Service Center (see "Seagate Technology Support
Services" section above).
6. Obtain a "ship to" address. Service Centers are located throughout the
world. The ship to address of
the facility nearest you will be included with the RMA.
7. Package and return the drive. IMPROPER PACKAGING WILL VOID THE WARRANTY. Be
sure to
read the Shipping and Handling Information (below). Your original drive will
NOT be returned to you, so
be sure to backup any data you wish to keep and return only the bare drive. If
you are unable to retrieve
needed data, you may want to consider data recovery services.
Once Seagate Technology receives your drive for service, Seagate will ship you
a replacement drive. You
may check the status of your replacement drive RMA shipment online or by
contacting a Seagate Service
Center Representative to obtain that information.
B. Shipping and Handling Information - Packaging Instructions
1. When you return a drive for replacement, all data and software will be lost.
The replacement drive will
be low-level formatted. If you need the data on the drive and do not have a
backup copy, you may want to
consider data recovery services before shipping the drive to Seagate for
replacement.
2. Remove all accessories or spare parts and return only the bare drive!
Accessories include, but are not
limited to, side rails, manuals, removable media, cables, mounting brackets,
face plates, and controller
cards. Accessories will not be returned.
3. Enclose the drive in an anti-static container. If packaging more than one
drive, use a separate bag for
each drive.
4. Secure the drive in Seagate approved packaging. Use 2-inch thick foam rubber
in a corrugated box.
Multiple drives in a single box should be packaged with foam rubber between
each drive. Do NOT use
foam packing pellets, bubble wrap, or newspaper. (See Seagate Approved
Packaging section, below.)
5. Write the RMA number on the outside of each box.
6. A shipping address will be given to you along with the RMA number. Ship the
drive to the address
provided using the carrier of your choice. You should choose a carrier with the
ability to trace the
shipment. Seagate Technology will not be responsible for shipments for which
the carrier cannot provide
proof of delivery.
C. Seagate Approved Packaging
Shipping a drive in an unapproved container voids the warranty. Any product
returned to Seagate must
be properly packaged in the original box or a Seagate-approved container to
prevent physical and
electrical damage while in transit. FAILURE TO PROPERLY PACKAGE THE DRIVE WILL
VOID THE
WARRANTY.
What is Seagate Approved Packaging?
We recommend you ship your drive in its original box and packing materials,
which you should always
keep for storing and shipping purposes. If you do not have your original
packaging materials, use 2-inch
thick foam rubber in a corrugated box. Multiple drives in a single box should
be packaged with foam
rubber between each drive. Do NOT use foam packing pellets, bubble wrap, or
newspaper.
Where can I get Seagate Approved Packaging?
Seagate does not separately sell packaging materials. While Seagate does not
endorse any one third
party vendor, companies that provide packaging materials can be found at:
