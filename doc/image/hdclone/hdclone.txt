12 Introduction
1.5  New in HDClone 5
Besides new technical features, HDClone 5 also offers some changes of the user
interface and in operating. They are described in the following subchapters.
1.5.1  Main screen
HDClone 5 offers a newly designed main screen (4ï¬g.î24). It shows the pro-
gram functions, grouped by area of use. The individual functions are described
in 47 Program functions. Furthermore, the new title bar (4ï¬g.î21) now con-
tains some basic functions that are available at any time (48.1.1 Title bar).
1.5.2  Program screens
User guidance within the program functions has been maintained for the most
part, but it has been improved for the favor of usability:
{
HotPlug & LiveScan: HDClone scans for newly connected or disconnected
drives and storage media automatically (48.3.1 Selecting a disk). The drive
selection list will then be updated dynamically.
{
When 48.3.3 Selecting an image (source or target), path names can also be
entered manually now. In Windows you can use copy-and-paste to insert
path names in the HDClone input field.
{
Images on hidden network shares: By entering the pathname manually, hid-
den network shares can now also be specified and used.
{
Size and speed details are displayed in the suitable magnitude level (KB, MB,
GB). Memory sizes are now also displayed in SI units (KB, MB, GB, TB) instead
of the binary based IEC units (KiB, MiB, GiB and TiB) like in previous
versions.
Note: The selection screens for source and target no longer contain
buttons for SpeedTest and DiskView. They are now to be found on the
Tools section of the main screen (47.5.1 SpeedTest, 47.5.2 DiskView).
1.5.3  Boot Setup
For better support of the new UEFI BIOSes, there is an UEFI option in the Boot
Setup (45.2 Boot-Setup).
Boot Setup no longer contains support for creating bootable floppy disks. In
case
you still require a bootable floppy disk, please contact our 413.3 Support.
Upgrading hard disks & migrating an OS  13
2  Fields of application
HDClone is specialized on creating physical copies. Therefore HDClone offers
particular advantages for copying and respectively rescuing defective media
(42.2 Data rescue). In addition, HDClone can work independently from parti-
tioning scheme, file system and operating system. This allows you to copy
entire
operating system installations (42.1 Upgrading hard disks & migrating an OS) or
to be able to create an exact copy in case of unknown/proprietary file systems
(42.6 Proprietary hard disk formats). Altogether, HDClone covers a wide spec-
trum of possible applications by its universal copying technology. In the
following
text you will find descriptions of the most common areas of the application of
HDClone. The individual chapters offer instructions as well as further tips
regard-
ing the execution of the application.
Hint: HDClone allows you to copy data arbitrarily between all types of
media recognized, particularly between different types of drives.
2.1  Upgrading hard disks & migrating an OS
Because  HDClone works independently of file system formats and operating
systems, you can use it to migrate entire installations, including the
installed op-
erating system, to another hard disk. This is especially useful if you want to
mi-
grate an existing installation to a new hard disk without having to install the
op-
erating system and applications again. For this type of application, the 47.1.1
Cloning disks mode is most suitable. Use the PartitionSelect feature (49.7
Parti-
tionSelect) to choose individual partitions to be cloned.
Note: Please take care to have only one hard disk connected after
completing the copy and before starting the operating system. It should
be plugged to the same channel as the original. Hence, either remove
the copy or connect it instead of the original medium.
2.1.1  Unused disk space
Free disk space on the target medium can be converted into a partition and
used as an additional drive from within Windows by using the fdisk tool or the
Windows Computer Management (C:\WINDOWS\system32\compmgmt.msc).
14  Fields of application
2.1.2  Smaller target medium
In general, you can also copy from a larger to a smaller medium. HDClone can
decrease your NTFS and FAT partition size automatically on the fly during copy-
ing. For other file systems, you may downsize the partitions on the source
medi-
um before cloning, using appropriate third-party tools before cloning.
2.2  Data rescue
In case of hard disks with defective areas it is especially important that they
are
being rescued to an intact medium before starting any recovery attempts. Oth-
erwise, depending on the kind of defect, the recovery procedure may cause
further defects resulting from the inherent exposure of this procedure. Of
course,
using HDClone also causes exposure to the hard disk. But the physical copying
causes much less exposure than any other usage due to its linear operation,
i.e.
only linear movement of the diskâs heads. Furthermore, the option SafeRescue
(48.3.4.1 General options) is able to reduce exposure to an absolute minimum.
In very critical cases, you can also just copy single partitions to reduce
exposure
for the medium even more (47.1.2 Cloning Partitions). After having rescued the
data from the defective hard disk, you can then perform a recovery on the
(func-
tional) target medium without having to fear any further damages.
Important: For the purpose of data rescue, create a 49.1.1 FullCopy or
49.1.3 BitCopy of the entire hard disk at first (or a 49.8.1 FullImage or
49.8.3 RAW images respectively). This clone then can be used to con-
duct recovery attempts without any risk for the original data.
Note: Only a physical copy allows you to rescue all of the data (except
irrecoverable areas), even if there are logical errors resulting from de-
fective areas. For this reason, never use SmartCopy mode (49.1.2
SmartCopy) for rescuing data.
Hint: Alternatively, you may create a RAW image, or a physical image.
You can then restore the image to another hard disk later, or perform
the recovery directly on the image by mounting it as a virtual drive us-
ing 412 Miray Virtual Disk.
2.3  Installation backup
HDClone
can also create a local backup of an entire system installation. If re-
quired, a simple restore from the backup partition brings the system
installation
back into its original state â without the previous affliction of faulty
program instal-
lations, viruses etc. For this purpose, create an unused partition in addition
to the
system partition of at least the same size to serve as a backup partition. Then
cre-
Forensic examination  15
ate a file image and restore the original system from that image when needed.
Note: Before restoring from the backup partition, save your work files
and other data from the system partition or store them somewhere
else, since they otherwise will be overwritten.
2.4  Mass copying
HDClone
Enterprise Edition is specially designed for creating up to 16 copies at a
time. This makes it especially suitable for industrial duplication of pre-
installed
software (e.g. on hard disks or on CompactFlash media etc.) or for creating
sev-
eral identical operating system installations (42.5 Master installations)
2.5  Master installations
HDClone is also suitable for duplicating (deployment) system installations
(42.4
Mass copying). Copying an entire master directly or from a file image to the
tar-
get medium to use it directly from there.
Note: For duplicating Windows installations, we recommend to run the
Microsoft tool sysprep  before cloning. Further information is to be
found at http://www.microsoft.com, search for âsysprepâ.
2.6  Proprietary hard disk formats
HDClone is capable of copying arbitrary hard disk formats. Especially for hard
disks installed in proprietary systems (e.g. studio technology, medical
technology
etc.) there are often no programs besides system software, which can read the
data on these media. HDClone can rescue this data and transfer it to a new
medium without any problem. The best way is to copy the original medium to a
target medium of the same or larger size. A target medium smaller than the
original medium should not be used, as it cannot be assured that all relevant
user
data will be transferred in this case.
Note: In case of unknown or proprietary (non-standardized) formats,
always copy the entire original medium. You should only use the mode
47.1.2 Cloning Partitions if you know for sure that the partitions are
reported correctly.
2.7  Forensic examination
HDClone is also suitable for securing data for forensic purposes, as all data
from
a disk is copied completely, including data that has possibly been hidden or
de-
leted. This data cannot be reached any more via the usual file system mecha-
16  Fields of application
nisms. Therefore it will be useful to create a copy in BitCopy mode (47.1.1
Cloning disks) or a RAW image (49.8.3 RAW images) before performing a de-
tailed forensic examination of secured disks. This allows you to make changes
to
the copy during analysis without altering and thus endangering the original
con-
tent of the medium.
Note: When backing up data for forensic examination, hidden and de-
leted files can be located anywhere on the medium, it is always re-
quired to create a copy of the entire medium to a target medium of the
same or larger size. Never use SmartCopy mode (49.1.2 SmartCopy) for this
type of application.
2.8  Image ï¬les
In  HDClone, working with physical and logical images follows the same basic
logic as physical and logical copies, which are performed directly from storage
medium to storage medium. File images offer the following advantages:
{
Simple storing and managing in your file system
{
Optional compression for minimum space required
{
Password protection and AES encryption to protect data
{
Use arbitrary storage media for exchange
{
Distributing without physical media via networks and the Internet
{
Accessing individual files via virtual drives (412 Miray Virtual Disk)
{
Virtual machines (49.8.4 VM-Images (VMDK, VHD/VHDX, VDI))
Example: To rescue a defective hard disk, you may create a physical
49.1.1 FullCopy
instead of a physical
49.8.1 FullImage
. Both cases will
result in a bit-wise identical clone of the master hard disk.
2.9  HotCopy & LiveImage
HDClone supports creating clones or images of a Windows drive while Windows
is working - even of the Windows system partition itself. To use this feature,
it is
not necessary to take certain steps. When using HDClone/W, the appropriate
mechanisms for using HotCopy and LiveImage will be activated automatically.

3.4  SATA
HDClone support SATA disks of any generation (SATA, SATA-II, SATA-6G). De-
pending on the BIOS settings, they can be used in AHCI or IDE operating mode.
It is recommended to set the SATA controller to AHCI operating mode in BIOS, if
available. In case the installed operating system requires IDE mode to boot,
AHCI
mode may just be set temporarily for the copying and be set back afterwards.
20  Supported hardware
3.4.1  SATA-Hotplug
Enterprise Edition required
To connect SATA devices to a running system (hot-plugging), the SATA controller
has to be set to AHCI (not IDE) operating mode in BIOS and the ports to be used
for hot-plugging to Hotplug. Alternatively, SATA ports can commonly also be
used for hot-plugging when they have a SATA device connected at power-on.
Warning: It is absolutely essential to set the AHCI operating mode for
the SATA controller in BIOS first. In IDE operating mode, plugging devices
to a running system usually generates a system crash.
3.4.2  Port-Multiplier
Enterprise Edition required
A port multipler allows to connect several SATA devices to a single SATA port,
sharing the transfer rate of the port. This makes it possible to connect more
SATA
disks at a time than native SATA ports are available. Disks connected over a
port
multiplier will be recognized and displayed automatically.
3.5  SCSI and SAS
Professional Edition or more advanced required
Under Windows, HDClone/W supports available SCSI and SAS drives, if a suitable
driver has been installed. HDClone/S currently only supports the following Nar-
row-, Wide-, Ultra- and Ultra-Wide-SCSI controllers from Adaptec:
AHA-2930U
AHA-2944UW
ASC-29160N
AHA-2940 Ultra
ASC-19160
ASC-39160
AHA-2940UW
ASC-29160
AHA-2940AU
ASC-29160LP
Hint: Use the Free Edition to determine whether your SCSI/SAS control-
ler is supported (43.3.1 Compatibility check). If HDClone recognizes
the connected drive, the SCSI/SAS controller is supported.
3.6  RAID
Professional Edition or more advanced required
HDClone can also clone RAIDs. There are three different variants:
{
RAID to normal disk
Firewire (IEEE1394)  21
{
RAID to RAID
{
normal disk to RAID
Cloning pure data RAIDs does not require any preliminary action. The same ap-
plies for cloning bootable system installations from a RAID to a normal medium
or to a RAID for the same type of RAID controller. Cloning bootable system in-
stallations to a RAID requires to ensure that a software driver for the target
RAID
has been installed on the source as a boot driver before starting with cloning.
3.6.1  RAID under Windows
In general, HDClone/W can use any mass storage medium available in Windows,
including RAIDs that are accessible as normal drives. They can be cloned with
HDClone â from and to normal disks as well. HDClone clones these RAIDs just
like normal drives. The special RAID substructure is hidden by Windows. Special
RAID properties are therefore invisible to HDClone/W.
3.6.2  Intel RAID
Since 2003 Intel offers chipsets with support for software RAIDs, which we
refer
to as Intel RAIDs here. HDClone/S allows to clone from, to and between Intel
RAIDs. For this purpose, RAIDs have to be connected to the internal Intel SATA
controller in their original configuration. The drive list shows available RAID
vol-
umes as disks. Only complete and sound RAIDs can be used as a target.
3.7  USB
HDClone can be used with USB devices of the USB versions 1.1 (UHCI, OHCI),
2.0 (EHCI) and 3.0 (XHCI). HDClone supports USB mass storage media (USB
Mass Storage Class), USB keyboards and mice (HID) and USB hubs.
3.8  Firewire (IEEE1394)
Professional Edition or more advanced required
HDClone works with any Firewire drive or Firewire card reader that supports the
Serial-Bus-Protocol (SBP).
Note: Please take care to connect Firewire devices prior to starting
HDClone and if possible directly to the PC or to the Firewire controller.

Bootable Medium button.
The Boot-Setup program window contains the following control elements:
{
UEFI bootcode: To ensure the bootable medium can be used with a modern
UEFI-BIOS, it additionally contains special UEFI bootcode. This allows the
bootable medium to be used with both, old and new BIOSes. In case you en-
counter any problems when starting from the bootable medium, deactivate
this option to create a bootable medium without UEFI bootcode.
{
Add startup script (special editions only): If your edition supports using an
INI
file to automate HDClone/S, you can specify the desired INI file here to have
it included in the bootable medium. Otherwise, this option will be deactivated.

Then click on Exit
. Continue at 46 Program startup or 44 Quickstart.
Note: When creating a CD/DVD, please always use a new, empty
writeable CD/DVD. Otherwise there may be problems when starting
HDClone.
5.3  Bootable Windows CD
When using HDClone with storage devices or controllers, which require special
Windows drivers, it has to be used directly on Windows. If there is no Windows
installation available, the options you to create a bootable Windows CD which
includes the required drivers are described in the following paragraphs.
5.3.1  BartPE (Windows XP)
BartPE creates a specially configured
Windows
XP system, that can be started
from CD. Download PE Builder at http://
www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/. A plug-in used
to integrate HDClone into the PE system
is to be found at http://www.miray-soft-
ware.com/public/support/HDClone-
BartPE-Plugin.en.zip. Install PE Builder on
your system and unpack the plug-in to
pebuilder3110a\plugin. Create the new
folder  HDClone there. Copy hdclone.
exe to pebuilder3110a\plugin\HD-
Clone\ï¬les. If the mass storage devices and controller on your target system
will
require special drivers, copy the driver files to pebuilder3110a\drivers\SCSI-
Adapter.
Then start pebuilder.exe from the folder pebuilder3110a. After few seconds, a
popup window appears (4ï¬g.î6). Please enter the path to the WindowsîXP
in-
stallation files in the input field on top. They are to be found on your
Windows
XP installation CD. Hence, this field usually contains the drive letter of your
CD/
DVD drive â except you have copied the installation files to another
location.
ï¬g.î6: PE Builder conï¬guration dialog
26 Installation
You can now choose a name and a location for the boot image by clicking on
Create ISO image in the box Media output. If another CD/DVD writer is avail-
able, you can immediately create a CD by clicking on Burn to CD/DVD. Other-
wise create an ISO image first.
After clicking on Start, PE Builder creates the CD. Depending on your system,
this
may take a few minutes. If you did not select Burn to CD/DVD in the previous
step, it is necessary to write the newly created ISO image to CD with your re-
cording software. Please note that the file has to be written to CD directly as
an
image. Normal writing will not be sufficient in this case. Instead, please
start your
recording software and choose Create from image ï¬le (or similar description,
depending on the recording software used).
Start your PC from the CD created. HDClone is to be found at Go
â¸ Programs.
5.3.2  Windows PE
You may also create a bootable CD version of Windows Vista, Windowsî7, or
Windowsî8/8.1. For this purpose, we recommend the freely available projects
of
CWCodes under http://www.cwcodes.net/.
You will find the projects for Windows Vista PE, Windowsî7îPE and
Windowsî8îPE
and Windowsî8.1 at the following URLs:
{
Windows Vista PE (VistaPE): http://vistape-capi.cwcodes.net/
{
Windows 7 PE (Win7PE SE): http://w7pese.cwcodes.net/
{
Windows 8 PE (Win8PE SE): http://w8pese.cwcodes.net/
{
Windows 8.1 PE (Win8.1 SE): http://win81se.cwcodes.net/
Along with HDClone, you may then also integrate additional device drivers; for
example for RAIDs into the ISO image. After booting the Windows PE CD, these
drivers will be available for HDClone as well.
5.3.3  Windows HotCopy
There is a practical alternative to creating a 45.3.1 BartPE (Windows XP) or
45.3.2 Windows PE to obtain a independently bootable Windows, for example
to use special Windows drivers for RAIDs or SCSI/SAS. Simply create a temporary
clone of an existing Windows Installation. Install additionally required
drivers be-
fore or after creating the clone. This clone then offers you a Windows that can
be booted independent from the installed operating system and start
HDClone/W there, similar to a BartPE or Windows PE.
ISO image  27
5.4  ISO image
The HDClone software package contains an ISO image (hdclone.iso):
{
After installing with 45.1 Setup for Windows in the Start menu:
Programs
â¸ HDClone 5... â¸ Boot-Setup.
{
In a program package in ZIP format as hdclone.iso.
{
On the genuine medium (CD/DVD or USB key) as hdclone.iso.
It can be used to create a bootable HDClone-CD in any operating system and
with any software supporting creation of CDs/DVDs from ISO images. Further
information can be found in the manual of your CD/DVD authoring software.
1. Extract the file hdclone.iso from the HDClone software package.
2. Start your CD writing software and choose Create CD from image ï¬le (or
sim-
ilar caption, according to the respective CD writing software).
3. Specify the file hdclone.iso as an image file.
4. Insert a blank CD into the drive and write the CD.
Hint: The easiest way of creating a bootable HDClone CD under Linux
is using the software tool cdrecord
with the following syntax:
cdrecord hdclone.iso
After having accomplished these steps you have created a bootable HDClone
CD. From this CD you can start HDClone directly on any PC with a bootable CD/
DVD drive as described in 46 Program startup.
Note: CD/DVD writing software may refuse writing an ISO image to a
DVD. The HDClone installation program writes DVDs without any prob-
lem. Booting from a DVD created this way also works smoothly.
28  Program startup
6  Program startup
6.1  Windows â HDClone/W
After installing (45.1 Setup for Windows), you may start HDClone from the Win-
dows start menu under Program
â¸ HDClone 5â¦ â¸ Start HDClone. Alternatively
HDClone can be started by invoking the file hdclone.exe from the genuine
HDClone medium or directly from the software package (ZIP archive).
6.2  Self-booting â HDClone/S
Connect the bootable USB key or insert the bootable CD/DVD (45.2 Boot-Set-
up). Start the PC and ensure that BIOS will boot from the desired medium.
HDClone will then be launched from the bootable medium.
Note: In case your PC does not boot from the HDClone boot medium,
press
F8 ,  F11  or  F12  (BIOS dependent) immediately after turn-
ing on the PC to enter the boot menu and select the bootmedium.
6.3  Quit program
In the lower right of the Main Screen (48.2 Main screen) you find a symbol for
closing the application (HDClone/W, 4ï¬g.î 24) or for powering off the PC
(HDClone/S, 4ï¬g.î20). Click on this symbol or press the
Esc  key to quit HD-
Clone.
If there is still a program function open, you can return to the main screen by
clicking on the Close-symbol X
in the upper right corner of the Control panel
(4ï¬g.î20) or pressing the
Esc  key. A process still running has to be finished or
cancelled at first.
Note: (HDClone/S only) If you do not want to start HDClone  when
starting the computer for the next time, remember to remove the
HDClone boot medium from the boot drive first.
Cloning 29
7  Program functions
The 48.2 Main screen contains several function groups, where the symbols for
the individual program functions. The following chapters contain a description
of
these functions and the steps required. There is also a detailed description of
the
individual steps in 48 Controls.
7.1  Cloning
This function group contains functions to create an identical copy (clone) of a
disk or selected partitions.
7.1.1  Cloning disks
FullCopy requires Free Edition
SmartCopy requires Standard Edition
This function clones disks. You can choose be-
tween transferring selected partitions or all parti-
tions to the target. The sizes the partitions will
have on the target can also be adjusted. Smart-
Copy only transfers the sectors which are marked as used by the file system.
This
will increase cloning speed considerably in most cases.
Note:
For cloning one single partition into an existing target partition
while keeping the remaining partitions on the target, please use the
function 47.1.2 Cloning Partitions.
Important: Activate 49.1.2 SmartCopy only in case of sound media
and sound file systems. Otherwise creating a 49.1.1 FullCopy or
49.1.3 BitCopy instead is strongly recommended. Check the disk integ-
rity before cloning as described in 411.5.1 Clone not booting .
Operating steps
1. Select source disk (48.3.1 Selecting a disk)
2. Select target disk (48.3.1 Selecting a disk)
3. Select copying options (48.3.4 Options)
4. Optional: 48.4.2 PartitionSelect
5. Optional: Adjust partition sizes (48.4.3 Adjusting partitions)
ï¬g.î7: FullCopy & SmartCopy
30  Program functions
6. 48.3.5 Copying data
7. Optional: 48.4.5 Adjust boot data
8. Final report/Finish (48.4.6 Final report)
7.1.2  Cloning Partitions
FullCopy (Partition) requires Free Edition
SmartCopy (Partition) requires Standard Edition
Clones the contents of a single partition into an-
other, already existing or newly created parti-
tion. When transferring a system partition, the
target has to be a bootable system partition, too,
since this copying function will transfer the parti-
tion contents only, but will not create a bootable entry. SmartCopy only
transfers
the sectors which are marked as used by the file system. This will increase
clon-
ing speed considerably in most cases.
Note:
For any other area of use, for example cloning several partitions
of a disk or a whole disk, please use 47.1.1 Cloning disks
.
Operating steps
1. Select source partition (48.3.2 Selecting a partition)
2. Select target partition (48.3.2 Selecting a partition)
3. Select copying options (48.3.4 Options)
4. Optional: Adjust partition size (48.4.3 Adjusting partitions)
5. 48.3.5 Copying data
6. Optional: 48.4.5 Adjust boot data
7. Final report/Finish (48.4.6 Final report)
7.1.3  BitCopy
Professional Edition or more advanced
This function, also known as âBare-Metal-Copyâ, will clone all
sectors of a disk without a difference whether they are
marked as occupied or not by the file system table or partition
table. This will result in a bitwise identical clone of the whole
medium or the selected areas.
ï¬g.î8: FullCopy (Partition) &
SmartCopy (Partition)
ï¬g.î9: BitCopy
Data backup  31
Note: BitCopy creates an exact clone of the whole disk. Usually, this is
only required in case of creating clones for data rescue or forensic exam-
ination. The SmartCopy function (
47.1.1 Cloning disks
) will also clone all
data, but skips disk areas marked as free or unused. It is therefore much
faster in
many cases.
Operating steps
1. Select source disk (48.3.1 Selecting a disk)
2. Select target disk (48.3.1 Selecting a disk)
3. Select copying options (48.3.4 Options)
4. Optional: 48.4.2 PartitionSelect
5. 48.3.5 Copying data
6. Optional: 48.4.5 Adjust boot data
7. Final report/Finish (48.4.6 Final report)
7.2  Data backup
This function group is available in all editions. It offers the most simple way
to
create a backup or to restore your system from a previous backup. Basically
this
function also uses file images. In contrast to the dedicated imaging functions
(47.3 File images), operating is focused on backups and therefore more stream-
lined for this use case. This function automatically uses the most suitable
options.
The file sizes of backups and the time required depend on the edition used,
since the function automatically uses the available features (for example Smar-
tImage or data compression).
7.2.1  Backup
all editions
Creates a backup of a whole hard disk, SSD, or other storage
media to a file image. It also allows to select only particular
partitions of the medium to be stored.
Operating steps
1. Select disk to be backed up (48.3.1 Selecting a disk)
2. Specify file to store the backup in (48.3.3 Selecting an image)
3. Select backup options (48.3.4 Options)
4. Optional: 48.4.2 PartitionSelect
ï¬g.î10: Store
32  Program functions
5. Start backup (48.3.5 Copying data)
6. Final report/Finish (48.4.6 Final report)
7.2.2  Recovery
all editions
This function restores a disk from a data backup, previously
created with 47.2.1 Backup or copies data from an image
created with FullImage, SmartImage, or BitImage back to a
disk. It is also possible to adjust the sizes the partitions con-
tained will have on the target medium.
Note: Only FullImage, SmartImage (
47.3.1 Disk Image
) and
47.3.2 BitI-
mage
can be restored to a disk. A
47.3.3 VM-Image
can be mounted by
412 Miray Virtual Disk or a virtual machine.
Operating steps
1. Select a backup or other file image (48.3.3 Selecting an image)
2. Select target disk to recover (48.3.1 Selecting a disk)
3. Optional: 48.4.2 PartitionSelect
4. Optional: Adjust partition size (48.4.3 Adjusting partitions)
5. Select recovery options (48.3.4 Options)
6. Start recovery (48.3.5 Copying data)
7. Final report/Finish (48.4.6 Final report)
7.3  File images
HDClone can store the content of a disk or other mass storage media to a file
image. Depending on the edition used, there are different image types and op-
tions available. FullImage, SmartImage and BitImage can be restored to a disk
(47.2.2 Recovery) or be mounted as a virtual disk under Windows for accessing
individual files and folders, using 412 Miray Virtual Disk. VM-Images can be
used as virtual disks with Miray Virtual Disk or by adding them to a virtual
ma-
chine.
Important: The use of SmartImage and VM-Image is recommended
with sound disks and file systems only. In other cases, create a FullImage
or BitImage. Check file system integrity with chkdsk /f (as described in
411.5.1 Clone not booting) prior to creating an image.
ï¬g.î11: Recover
File images  33
Operating steps
1. Select source disk (48.3.1 Selecting a disk)
2. Specify file image to store the data in (48.3.3 Selecting an image)
3. Optional: 48.4.2 PartitionSelect
4. Select file image options (48.3.4 Options)
5. Start file image creation (48.3.5 Copying data)
6. Final report/Finish (48.4.6 Final report)
7.3.1  Disk Image
FullImage requires Free Edition
SmartImage requires Standard Edition
This function allows you to store the contents
of a disk to a file image. You can either store
selected partitions or all partitions of the
source. SmartImage only transfers the sectors
which are marked as used by the file system. This will reduce the time required
to create the image and the image size considerably in most cases, compared to
FullImage (47.3.1 Disk Image) and 47.3.2 BitImage.
Operating steps see 47.3 File images
7.3.2  BitImage
Professional Edition or more advanced
This function creates an image containing all sectors of a disk
without a difference whether they are marked as occupied or
not by the file system table or partition table, similar to 47.1.3
BitCopy. This will result in a bitwise identical image of the
whole medium.
Note: BitImage creates an exact image of all data areas. Usually, this is
only required for data rescue or forensic images. The SmartImage function
(
47.3.1 Disk Image
) will also store all data, but omits disk areas marked
as free or unused. It is therefore much faster and creates smaller images in
many
cases.
Operating steps see 47.3 File images
ï¬g.î12: FullImage & SmartImage
ï¬g.î13: BitImage
34  Program functions
7.3.3  VM-Image
Professional Edition or more advanced
This function creates images for virtual machines in one of the
available formats (49.8.4 VM-Images (VMDK, VHD/VHDX,
VDI)). They can then be mounted as a virtual drive with 412
Miray Virtual Disk or be added to a virtual machine. A VM-
Image only stores the sectors marked as used in the file sys-
tem, similar to a SmartImage. In most cases this results in a clearly higher
speed
when creating an image and a clearly smaller image size compared to a FullIm-
age and a BitImage.
Note: VM-Images can be used with
412 Miray Virtual Disk
or a virtual
machine. Restoring them to a disk using the
47.2.2 Recovery
function is
not supported.
Operating steps see 47.3 File images
7.4  MultiCopy
This function group combines functions that allow to copy to several disks at
once.
7.4.1  Multi-SmartCopy
Enterprise Edition or more advanced
Creates several clones onto the selected target disks. Only
transfers areas marked as used by the file system, similar to
the SmartCopy function (47.1.1 Cloning disks).
Operating steps
1. Select source disk (48.3.1 Selecting a disk)
2. Select target disks (48.3.1 Selecting a disk)
3. Optional: 48.4.2 PartitionSelect
4. Optional: Adjust partition size (48.4.3 Adjusting partitions)
5. Select copying options (48.3.4 Options)
6. Start copying process (48.3.5 Copying data)

show-
ing the progress of the current run (48.3.5.4 Copying sequence) in percent.
8.3.5.3  Progress bar
The progress bar (4ï¬g.î21) below the percentage indicator visualizes the
prog-
ress of the current run. Which run (48.3.5.4 Copying sequence) is currently be-
ing processed is shown on the left above the progress bar.
8.3.5.4  Copying sequence
The entire process consists of up to three runs:
1. Copying run: The actual data transfer. Depending on the program function
and settings, this run starts with a file system analysis.
2. Error recovery run: In case of errors occurring during copying, the affected
areas will be copied again (SafeRescue option, 48.3.4.1 General options).
3. Veriï¬cation run: The optional verification is conducted in a separate run
(Ver-
ifying option, 48.3.4.1 General options).
8.3.5.5  Cancellation
You can use Stop
to interrupt the process
(4ï¬g.î32). You may then continue the pro-
cess or ultimately cancel it. You will then ob-
tain a final report (48.4.6 Final report).
Note: Unlike a cancelled copying
run, a cancelled verification run has no influence on the copied data.
The copy itself is already finished completely after the copying run.
8.3.5.6  Regular termination
After up to three runs (48.3.5.4 Copying sequence) without a 48.3.5.5 Can-
cellation, the copying process is terminated normally. A final report for the

This popup is used to browse folders
for file images. The list on the left side
shows folders and file images. Folders
are trailed by a <DIR> identifier, imag-
es by their size value. Other files are
not displayed. The box on the right
contains more information on the se-
lected image.
Confirm the selection with OK

8.4.2  PartitionSelect
Use this popup (4ï¬g.î 34)
to select which partitions to
copy and which to exclude
from copying. If the select-
ed partitions exceed the
capacity of the target, the
bar turns red. In this case,
deselect partitions until the
remaining partitions fit on
the target. Or click Cancel
to select a different combi-
nation of source and target for creating the copy.
By default, all partitions are selected. Otherwise deselect the partitions to
be ex-
cluded from copying by clicking on the check symbol (
) below the partition
number. A lock symbol ( ) appears and the partition will not be copied.
Clicking
on the lock symbol will unlock the partition and the check symbol appears.
When you have selected all partitions as desired, click on Continue
.
In case you want to copy all partitions and to skip the adjustment step (48.4.3
Adjusting partitions), use Skip adjustment
. Any previous partitions selection will
then be ignored and all partitions will be copied in their original size and

8.4.3  Adjusting partitions
In case partition sizes can
be altered, a popup win-
dow appears before starting
the copying process
(4ï¬g.î 35). It allows you to
adjust the size of several or
all partitions to fit on the tar-
get medium as desired. Po-
sitions and sizes of the parti-
tions on the target medium
are displayed graphically in
a bar. Each partition has a
cipher or â from the tenth
partition on â a letter assigned to it. If you click on a partition in the
bar, the box
on the lower left will display additional information on the selected
partition. Be-
low each partition number, there is either a double arrow (
, default setting),
showing that the partition size can be altered, or a lock-symbol ( ),
indicating
that the partition size is fixed. By clicking on these symbols, you can toggle
be-
tween both modes. This allows to keep the original sizes of certain partitions,
while changing others or have them adjusted automatically.
Example: System partition (C:) and data partitions (D: and E:). For clon-
ing to a larger disk, only the latter shall be expanded, not the system
partition. First, click on the symbol below the system partition number
to fix the system partitionâs size â the lock-symbol appears. To distribute
the avail-
able space to the data partitions proportionally select Automatic adjustment
FAT, NTFS, and ext2/ext3/ext4 can be expanded, FAT and NTFS can also be re-
duced in size. A partition can only be reduced to the minimum amount of space
required by the data stored. Expanding or reducing partition sizes can be
accom-
plished either automatically (proportional to the size of the target disk) or
manu-
ally to an arbitrary size. The original size is displayed in light green, the
minimal
size achievable in dark green. Additionally assigned space (expansion) is dis-
played in striped light green. Partitions displayed in black cannot be altered.
Free,
unassigned space is displayed in white. There are three options to handle free
space on the target medium (48.4.3.1 Keep original sizes, 8.4.3.2 Automatic
adjustment, 8.4.3.3 Free adjustment). Select the desired option. In case of
Free
adjustment, make the desired changes, then click on Apply adjustments
. In case
of clones and partitions images, the Continue without adjustment
button is also
visible. This will transfer the partitions of the source to the target medium
with-
out any changes. Clicking Cancel
will return to the Copy data dialog page.
ï¬g.î35: Adjust partitions
Popup windows  49
Note: Click on Continue without adjustment to transfer the original par-
tition layout to the target. Keep original sizes will keep the original parti-
tion sizes, but shift them to the beginning of the disk for a better utiliza-
tion of free space.
8.4.3.1  Keep original sizes
The original sizes of partitions on the
source will be kept on the target me-
dium (4ï¬g.î36). The partitions them-
selves will be âshifted togetherâ at the beginning of the target, if
possible. This
approach is useful since it closes gaps between partitions, gaining additional
space which is made available in one single block at the end of the medium.
8.4.3.2  Automatic adjustment
Free space on the target medium will
be apportioned completely to the in-
dividual partitions, proportional to
their respective size (4ï¬g.î37). All partitions will be expanded
proportionally.
Calculation of the size proportions is handled automatically by HDClone.
8.4.3.3  Free adjustment
You can adjust the apportioning of ad-
ditional space on the target medium
to the individual partitions by yourself
(4ï¬g.î38). You can change the size of a certain partition by clicking and
dragging
the corresponding area on the graphical representation.
8.4.4  Security query
This security query (4ï¬g.î39) pops up before
finally starting a cloning process or a restore
from an image. Click Start copying
to start the
copying process or Cancel
to return without
starting the copying process.
Warning: Any data in the target area
will be irretrievably deleted by start-
ing the copying process and even data recovery software will not be
able to retrieve the overwritten data.

Copy modes  53
9  Mode of operation
HDClone can handle entire disks as well as individual partitions. Copies can be
created directly to target disks or into file images. HDClone offers different
modes and options for different use cases.
Important: For data rescue, create a full 49.1.3 BitCopy or a RAW im-
age (49.8.3 RAW images) of the entire disk first. You can then try dif-
ferent recovery attempts without putting the original data at risk.
9.1  Copy modes
HDClone offers several copy modes to directly transfer the data of one disk to
another.
9.1.1  FullCopy
FullCopy (physical copy) is a universal copy mode offered by all editions of
HDClone.it creates an exact clone of all partitions of a disk and optionally
also
the sectors in between (Copy free areas, 48.3.4.1 General options). Partitions
are cloned as a whole, regardless of the actual utilization of their sectors.
This al-
lows to clone arbitrary file systems.
Note: FullCopy is available in all editions of HDClone. In order to use the
FullCopy mode with editions, which also offer the 49.1.2 SmartCopy
mode, deactivate the SmartCopy option (48.3.4.2 Cloning options).
9.1.2  SmartCopy
With SmartCopy (logical copy) HDClone only takes those areas of a storage me-
dium that are occupied by the operating system and other files. Any unused ar-
eas will not be copied. Since in most cases only a part of the total capacity
of
storage media is occupied, SmartCopy saves â depending on the amount of
data stored â some of the time needed for a FullCopy. For this reason,
SmartCopy
usually is by a multiple faster than FullCopy.
For cloning disks with SmartCopy (4ï¬g.î 46), activate the
SmartCopy option (48.3.4.2 Cloning options). SmartCopy
mode can be applied to entire disks or other media as well as
to single partitions. SmartCopy currently supports NTFS, FAT,
ext2 and ext3 file systems. Partitions with other file systems,
ï¬g.î46: Smart-
Copy
54  Mode of operation
will be copied in FullCopy mode, even if the SmartCopy option is activated.
Note: SmartCopy evaluates the file system and depends on file system
data being consistent and free of errors. Otherwise the copy may con-
tain errors as well. In case you are not sure, you may check the source
with chkdsk /f before cloning.
SmartCopy also creates an exact clone, but in contrast to 49.1.1 FullCopy, only
copying the used areas of the medium. For many cases of use, this mode is pref-
erable, since it delivers the same result in less time.
Hint: Since it is only a clone, you can always try SmartCopy mode first.
If it turns out not to be sufficient for your individual case of use, you can
still create a FullCopy.
Warning: Never use SmartCopy mode for 42.2 Data rescue, for copy-
ing defective or inconsistent file systems, or for 42.7 Forensic examina-
tion. Rather create a FullCopy or 49.1.3 BitCopy in these cases.
9.1.3  BitCopy
BitCopy (bitwise physical copy) creates a complete or partial (49.5 Area copy)
clone of a storage medium. This clone is bit by bit identical with the source,
since
each sector of the source will be copied exactly to the same sector on the tar-
get. This is the main difference between BitCopy and 49.1.1 FullCopy.
Important: For a complete BitCopy of all areas of the source, also select
the Copy free areas option. This is especially required when performing
data rescue or forensic examination.
9.2  Size differences
To create a real BitCopy, source and target must have exactly the same size.
HDClone is also capable to create physical copies if the size of source and
target
differs. But the result will not be an absolutely identical clone.
Hint: The following subchapters refer to the usage of 49.1.3 BitCopy.
With 49.1.2 SmartCopy the contents of the source can usually be ad-
justed automatically to the size of the target.
9.2.1  Equal size
If source and target have exactly the same size and 47.1.3 BitCopy mode is se-
lected, HDClone creates an identical copy. On this clone â provided there
were
no errors â all sectors on the target are 100% identical with the source.
Automatic troubleshooting  55
9.2.2  Small to large
If the source is smaller than the target,
HDClone
clones all source data, from the
beginning of the source, onto the target medium. The area at the end of the
tar-
get medium, which is larger than the source, remains unaffected. The unaffected
area remains possibly unused during a later usage, such a copy is usually
compa-
rable to a real clone as far as the capacity of use is concerned because the
target
contains entirely all data of the source (in contrast to 49.2.3 Large to
small).
9.2.3  Large to small
If the source is bigger than the target, HDClone copies only the data which
also
fits onto the target. This data is copied from the beginning of the source to
the
beginning of the target medium. The data, which is larger than the target, is
not
copied and is missing on the target. Generally, such a copy is unusable or only
very restrictedly usable because possibly necessary data can be missing. How-
ever, if you make sure before copying (e.g. by defragmentation), that all valid
or
necessary data is in the front part of the source medium and that this area is
not
larger than the target medium, a copy onto a smaller target medium can also be
successfully used. This also applies if you have copied a smaller source onto a
larger target (49.2.2 Small to large) and if you copy back the (unchanged) data
onto the original medium or onto a target of the corresponding size.
9.3  Veriï¬cation
The Verifying option (48.3.4.1 General options) allows to compare source and
target after the copying process. The entire process including copying and
veri-
fication requires about twice the time. Select this option according to your
re-
quirements and the available time.
Warning: When copying defective disks (data rescue), do not activate
veriï¬cation. The additional exposure may increase existing defects.
And a verification has virtually no significance in case of defective disks.
9.4  Automatic troubleshooting
HDClone tries to troubleshoot occurring sector errors automatically in the best
possible way. If this is not possible, the errors will be counted in a
corresponding
error statistic.
9.4.1  Intensive reading/writing
In case of read errors, HDClone uses different strategies in order to recover
these sectors. The time used for this depends on the type and size of medium
56  Mode of operation
used. For each sector, several seconds up to minutes can be needed for the re-
covery attempts. Therefore, it is recommended to always activate the option
SafeRescue (48.3.4.1 General options) since handling of defective sectors will
then be done after the copying of all intact areas has been finished. The
process
can then be cancelled if it takes too long without losing the data of the
intact
areas.
9.4.2  Read errors
During the copying process, read errors can only occur on the source medium.
HDClone then tries to read the defective areas immediately after the termina-
tion of the copying process (option SafeRescue,  48.3.4.1 General options)
within a separate error recovery run (48.3.5.4 Copying sequence). During the
error recovery run, the number of the indicated read errors can reduce depend-
ing on the areas on the source which could be recovered.
Note:
Read errors occurring during verification are counted as verifica-
tion errors (48.3.5.1 Status indication). Since at verification time cloning
has been finished already, there will be no further error recovery.
9.4.3  Write errors
Write errors can only occur during the copying process and only on the target
medium. HDClone then tries to read the defective areas immediately after the
termination of the copying process (with the option SafeRescue, 48.3.4.1 Gen-
eral options) with the help of special data recovery strategies within a
separate
error recovery run (48.3.5.4 Copying sequence). During the error recovery run,
the number of the indicated write errors can decrease depending on the recov-
erable areas on the target.
9.4.4  Veriï¬cation errors
When the option Verifying (49.3 Veriï¬cation) is activated, HDClone executes a
verification run (48.3.5.4 Copying sequence) after the copying process. A veri-
fication error is counted if the data of two sectors on source and target do
not
correspond. Furthermore, read errors, which occur during the verification run
in
one or both of the areas to be compared, are also counted as verification
errors.
The number of verification errors gives you absolute information on how exact
source and target correspond to each other after cloning.
Note: Verification will only be performed on sectors that have been
copied previously. Since SmartCopy only will copy data from used sec-
tors, verification will only compare these sectors.
MultiCopy 57
9.5  Area copy
In case of an area copy, not the entire storage medium (drive/partition) of
source or target (or both) will be used, but only a partial area.
9.5.1  Usage
The dialog page Options provides the possibility to specify an exactly
definable
sector area for source and target (48.3.4.2 Cloning options). To specify a
sector
area, activate the check box Sector area and enter the starting (from) and the
ending (to) sector of the area. These sectors are interpreted as the first and
the
last sector of the area, i.e. they are included with the area.
Note: Counting starts with â0â (= 1st sector of the medium), so all further
sector numbers have to be decreased by 1 (e.g. fromî=î0, toî=î99999
defines the first 100000 sectors on the medium as an area).
Warning: Only use area copy if you are completely aware of its func-
tioning. A sector area, which has not been defined properly, may lead
to data loss or render the result unusable.
9.5.2  Mode of operation
Sector area means a contiguous area of sectors on a storage medium. In the
case of partitions, it is specified relative to their starting positions.
HDClone will
then copy the first sector of the source, to the first sector of the target
area and
so on. Compared to a normal BitCopy, the main difference is that the defined
partial area is cloned instead of the entire drive or partition.
Example: Sector area fromî=î0, toî=î31. For drives, this defines the
(ab-
solute) first 32 sectors. The absolute position of the first 32 sectors of a
partition depends on its (absolute) start on the drive.
9.6  MultiCopy
In case of a MultiCopy (mass copy) the contents of the source are copied on
multiple targets at the same time. As a result there is a huge benefit
regarding
time and performance, since the source data only has to be read once and the
data can be written on multiple targets at the same time.
9.6.1  Mode of operation
When selecting a program function from the MultiCopy group (47.4 MultiCo-
py), the target selection dialog page (48.3.1 Selecting a disk) allows to
select
58  Mode of operation
multiple targets from the list. The rest of the process works just like copying
to a
single disk.
Note: When creating a MultiCopy, the result on a single medium is
identical with the result of a single copy. Even the values for automatic
resizing will be calculated separately for each target.
9.6.2  Speed
Using MultiCopy yields strong advantage in speed compared to single copies. In
case of optimal connected media (49.6.3 Different media) , speed increases
directly proportional with the number of target media. For example, a fourfold
copy yields about four times the data throughput of a single copy.
Note: Please note that the achievable speed depends on the hardware
used (optimally SATA, USB3, IDE, or SAS/SCSI) and on the maximum
speed of the individual disks.
9.6.3  Different media
MultiCopy can be used with an arbitrary combination of drive types. Differences
in performance of different media types may have an impact on the total per-
formance. It is recommended to use IDE drives configured as master only.
9.7  PartitionSelect
Partitions on the source are
displayed in a graphical bar
(4ï¬g.î 47) and numbered
(with letters after the ninth
partition). Beneath the par-
tition number, there is a
check symbol (
, default
setting), if the partition will
be included in, or a block-
ing-symbol (
), if this parti-
tion will be excluded from
the clone. Click on these symbols, to include or exclude any partition
individu-
ally. Changes to the total size by selecting and de-selecting partitions will
be dis-
played.
PartitionSelect provides a way to transfer only certain partitions and to leave
others out. Hence, you can use PartitionSelect to reduce the storage size re-
quired for the target.
ï¬g.î47: PartitionSelect dialog
File images  59
9.8  File images
Besides direct clones, HDClone is also capable of storing images of a medium
into a file. An image contains the same data as a clone. When an image has been
restored to another medium, the result is the same as if it had been copied di-
rectly from the original source.
9.8.1  FullImage
A FullImage (physical Image) stores â similar to a 49.1.1 FullCopy â all
sectors of
the disk or selected partitions and optionally all sectors in between (Copy
free
areas, 48.3.4.1 General options) in a file image.
Note: FullImage is available in all editions. In editions, which also support
other image types, explicitly select FullImage if desired when creating
an image (48.3.3 Selecting an image).
9.8.2  SmartImage
A SmartImage (logical Image) stores â analog to a 49.1.2 SmartCopy â only
the
areas of a medium that are occupied with file system data. A SmartImage usu-
ally requires much less disk space and time for creation than a 49.8.1
FullImage.
9.8.3  RAW images
RAW images are also physical images. They contain the same data like FullImages
(including Copy free areas, 48.3.4.1 General options). HDClone just uses a spe-
cial file format for FullImages, which optimally supports HDClone specific fea-
tures (e.g. SafeRescue). RAW images contain data in the same linear order as it
is
stored on a medium. This makes it faster and easier to process image files with
third party programs, especially when mounting them in 412 Miray Virtual Disk.
Hint: RAW images created by HDClone automatically contain a VMDK
file required to mount them directly as virtual drives in VMware or oth-
er virtual machines (49.8.4 VM-Images (VMDK, VHD/VHDX, VDI)).
9.8.4  VM-Images (VMDK, VHD/VHDX, VDI)
In addition to its native image formats, HDClone is also able to create dynamic
VM-Images to be used in virtual machines. It offers the following formats: VMDK
(VMware), VHD/VHDX (Virtual PC) and VDI (VirtualBox). They only contain ac-
tually used areas of the source and therefore are usually much smaller than
49.8.3 RAW images â similar to a 49.8.2 SmartImage. Due to their technical
characteristics, VM-Images are slightly larger than SmartImages. And it is not
pos-
60  Mode of operation
sible to exactly calculate their final size in advance. During creation, this
may
lead to a deviation from the predicted size.
Note: Compression and encryption are not available for VM-Images. In
this case, select a SmartImage and the appropriate options instead
(48.3.4.3 Backup options).
VM-Images created with HDClone can be used as virtual drives in virtual ma-
chines. For further information, please refer to the manual of your version of
VM-
ware, VirtualPC, or VirtualBox. From Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 on,
you can also mount VHD/VHDX images as virtual drives using the Windows Disk
Management tool (diskmgmt.msc).
412 Miray Virtual Disk can mount both formats under Windows as virtual drives.
This allows you to access the files and folders stored in them without opening
the image in a virtual machine.
Note: A virtual VM-Image drive mounted with Miray Virtual Disk can be
read AND written, but changes are not stored directly in the image. But
you can use the virtual drive to create a new image including all chang-
es made (412.7 Copy to other Image formats).
When creating 49.8.3 RAW images, a VMDK file will be created automatically.
Opening the HDClone file image with VMware, you will be displayed a VMDK
file of the same name. You then can select and use the file. The VMDK files
HDClone creates comply with HWversion=4 and are specified to be used with
the following versions of VMware:
{
VMware Player starting from version 1.x
{
VMware Workstation starting from version 5.x
{
VMware Server starting from version 1.x
{
VMware ESXi starting from version 3
9.8.5  Usage
When 48.3.3 Selecting an image you can specify the type of the image to be
created. FullImages can be created from any supported disk type. For creating
SmartImages, the source disk has to be formatted with FAT, NTFS, ext2/ext3.
With HDClone/S you can use FAT32 or NTFS formatted disks for reading and
writing image files. HDClone/W also supports network dives and network shares.
File images  61
9.8.6  Compressed Images
When creating a file image, the Options dialog page (48.3.4
Options) offers you to create a compressed image. Please
choose the option Compression to have HDClone compress
the file image. You will then be able to choose between nor-
mal compression (default), QuickCompress and Strong-
Compress (4ï¬g.î 48).  QuickCompress offers a lower com-
pression ratio than Normal compression, but to run it requires almost no
additional runtime. To create backups quickly while saving some space, please
choose QuickCompress. To maximize the amount of space saved, please choose
StrongCompress, which needs more time for achieving maximum compression.
When using file images in HDClone, there is â except file sizes â no
difference
between compressed and uncompressed file images from the userâs point of
view. Creating compressed file images will consume more time than decom-
pressing file images when restoring. Therefore, transfer speed when restoring
compressed file images is usually faster than creating compressed file images.
Note: Activating compression usually leads to a lower copying speed,
since compressing data consumes extra time. But in some cases, creat-
ing compressed file images may even lead to a higher copying speed.
Especially when the medium containing the file image is relatively slow, for
ex-
ample slow USB keys, mass storage media connected via USB 1.1, or slow net-
work drives and when using QuickCompress.
9.8.7  Password-Protection
When creating file images, you can protect them with a password (option Pass-
word protection, 48.3.4 Options). HDClone will not restore a file image that is
password protected unless the correct password is specified. It is also not
possi-
ble to open or mount a password protected file image with 412 Miray Virtual
Disk without specifying the correct password first.
Important: Password protection is a simple access protection for file im-
age. HDClone and Miray Virtual Disk will deny any access without the
correct password. For secure protection of the file image data, choose
the Data Encryption option (49.8.8 Encryption).
9.8.8  Encryption
If you select the Data Encryption option when creating a file image (48.3.4 Op-
tions) , the data in the image will be encrypted. HDClone uses a 128/256 bit
AES
encryption for this purpose. The image data then cannot be read without the
ï¬g.î48: Strong-
Compress
62  Mode of operation
specified password, neither with HDClone or 412 Miray Virtual Disk and not
with other software tools.
Warning: Since the data encryption used in HDClone is a secure meth-
od without a displacement password, image data created with encryp-
tion will definitely be irrecoverable if the password gets lost.
Note: Currently, encrypted file images cannot be opened and mount-
ed as virtual drives with Miray Virtual Disk.
Hint: Encryption will usually increase the time required for creating and
restoring file images significantly. Select Data Encryption only if it is re-
quired. Otherwise the password protection mechanism may also be suf-
ficient and it will not increase the duration of the process.
9.8.9  Images from CD/DVD/BD
HDClone cannot store file images directly on CD/DVD/BD, but can read file im-
ages from there for restoring. Insert the CD/DVD/BD into the drive before
start-
ing HDClone or when the main screen opens. Select 47.2.2 Recovery mode.
When selecting the source image, the CD/DVD drive will appear in the list and
you can choose a source image from there.
Note: When writing an HDClone image to CD/DVD/BD it is required to
use an ISO file system. Please consider the manual of your disc writing
software in this case. The CD/DVD/BD media has to contain the entire
image. So called âspanningâ of the file image is not supported by HDClone
But
you can choose a file block size, matching the capacity of the target medium
optimally (48.3.4.3 Backup options).
9.9  Defragmentation
HDClone can perform a defragmentation for NTFS and
FAT file systems during copying. On the 48.3.4 Options
dialog page, select Defragmentation (4ï¬g.î49). Apart
from the general advantages of a defragmentation, in
particular the acceleration of file accesses and the boot
process, HDClone offers the special advantage of performing the defragmenta-
tion process with only a little additional time required. Downsizing or defrag-
menting can also be selected when restoring from file images if it has been
cre-
ated using the options Store downsizing info or Store defrag info (48.3.4.1
General options).
ï¬g.î49: Defragmenta-
tion
Defragmentation 63
Important: Use defragmentation on healthy file systems only, meaning
only those file systems being declared flawless by programs like chkdsk.
exe (under Windows).
Note: When downsizing partitions, HDClone may also shift data blocks.
This shifting aims to reduce the file systemâs size in as few steps as pos-
sible. For a real defragmentation select the option Defragmentation ex-
plicitly, even when downsizing a file system.
64  Command line (CLI)
10 Command line (CLI)
You can include HDClone in automated workflows like shell scripts or time-trig-
gered tasks. For this kind of usage, there is a command line version of HDClone
(hdclone-cl.bat), to be found in the program folder of HDClone. It is
especially
suitable for the following fields of application:
{
Calling it from shell scripts or batch files.
{
Creating a permanent link on the Desktop or in the Start menu.
{
Creating time triggered tasks by calling HDClone through the Task Scheduler.
This allows to integrate HDClone seamless into existing scripts or batch
process-
es. You can also create Desktop links for frequently used cloning
configurations
to easily call them manually or automatically on demand. Usage of hdclone-cl.
exe is described in detail in 410.1 Command line interface.
10.1 Command line interface
To use HDClone for automated processes or time-triggered calls, there is the
ad-
ditional file hdclone-cl.bat for calling HDClone from the Windows command line.
This program is destined to be called by shell scripts or program links. It
handles
user input and output exclusively via the command line and calling parameters.
This allows to use the command line version for areas of application, for which
the graphical version is not suitable, like the following examples:
{
Time-triggered calling: Scheduled calls of HDClone by the Windows Task
Manager to start copying processes automatically, for example backups.
{
Script integration: Calling HDClone from scripts for integrating it into auto-
mated processes, for example for mass installation (deployment).
{
Programmed processes: For recurring copying processes, you can create links
in the Start Menu, the Quick Launch bar, or on the Desktop to allow these pro-
grammed processes to be called quickly and easily at any time.
Hint: When calling hdclone-cl -help or without any parameters, a list of
supported parameters in combination with a short description of their
usage will be displayed.
The following chapters list and explain the supported parameters. The order of
individual parameters when calling hdclone-cl is arbitrary.
Command line interface  65
10.1.1 Start Menu
To facilitate the use of the command line version, it has its own Start Menu
entry.
Under the HDClone entry, you find the sub-folder CLI. It contains two subitems:
{
HDClone CLI: Opens a privileged Windows Shell in the program folder, so you
can directly start the command line version from here.
{
Scripting templates: Opens a folder with templates for batch scripts in the
Windows Explorer. You may customize them according to your needs.
Important:
Along with the scripting templates there is an hdclone-cl.bat
file. Use it instead of calling hdclone.exe cl, especially in complex scripts
to ensure you obtain the correct result values (410.1.7 Return values).
Replace the call of hdclone-cl.exe from earlier versions with hdclone-cl.bat.
10.1.2 Program call
The command line version of HDClone expects the following calling syntax:
{
D2D â Copying an entire drive
hdclone-cl -mode:d2d -srcdrv:[source] -dstdrv:[target]
{
P2P â Copying a single partition
hdclone-cl -mode:p2p -srcvol:[source] -dstvol:[target]
{
D2I â Creating a ï¬le image of an entire drive
hdclone
-cl -mode:d2i -srcdrv:[
source
] -dstvol:[
target
] -dstimg:[image]
{
P2I â Creating a ï¬le image of a single partition
hdclone
-cl -mode:p2i -srcvol:[
source
] -dstvol:[
target
] -dstimg:[image]
{
I2D â Restoring a ï¬le image to an entire drive
hdclone
-cl -mode:i2d -srcvol:[
source
] -srcimg:[image] -dstdrv:[
target
]
{
I2P â Restoring a ï¬le image to a single partition
hdclone
-cl -mode:i2p -srcvol:[
source
] -srcimg:[image] -dstvol:[
target
]
Note: When using Enterprise Edition with more than one target, the
calling syntax is extended as follows: the parameter combinations
-dstdrv:[target],  -dstvol:[target] or -dstvol:[target] -dstimg:[ï¬lename]
have to be specified iteratively, one for each copying target.
Providing the parameters described above is mandatory. If one of the parame-
ters is missing or has an invalid value, the call will be canceled with an
error.
Note: Drive-to-Partition and Partition-to-Drive modes are not available
in the command line version. Please use the functions for creating and
restoring file images instead.
66  Command line (CLI)
10.1.3 Drive identiï¬cation
To allow more areas of use for physical drives (-srcdrv:[source]/-dstdrv:
[target]),
there are different ways to specify a drive:
{
Drive by Windows ID: Physical drives are usually specified by their respective
ID, assigned by Windows at run-time. This ID is to be found in the Disk Man-
agement of Windows (diskmgmt.msc).
{
Drive by port: You can also specify the port that is used to connect the drive
(not for USB and Firewire). If you specify the 2nd SATA port for the source,
the
drive connected to it will be used, regardless of the Windows ID assigned to
it.
{
Drive by name / serial number: Alternatively, a drive can be selected by its
type name and /or serial number, regardless of the Windows ID assigned to it
or over which port it is connected. But it has to be unique in the context of
the
copy to be created (and the Edition used).
Hint: You can use hdclone-cl -list to display a list of the available physi-
cal drives and their respective indications: Windows ID, port number,
and name/serial number.
In case there are several targets available under the identification provided,
HDClone Enterprise Edition will take this specification as unambiguous if the
number of drives is smaller than or equal to the maximal number of targets.
Example: If you specify a drive name as a target which matches five
drives in the system, HDClone Enterprise Edition 8x will use all five
drives as targets, while the Enterprise Edition 4x will refuse cloning due
to the ambiguity.
Note: If HDClone cannot make an unambiguous selection for the port
or identification specified, HDClone will cancel the process with an er-
ror.
10.1.4 File image paths
File images are specified as source or target using the full file path (drive
letter or
network share, folder path and image name).
10.1.5 Network shares
File images can also be created directly on network shares or be recovered from
there. Just use -srcimg:[source]/-dstimg:[target] to specify a path for the
net-
work share instead of a drive letter. The network path must have the form:
\\[domain|computer]\[share]\[folderpath]\[imagename]
Command line interface  67
For example â\\MyComputer\sharedfolder\backup\latest\mypc.imgâ.
10.1.6 Optional parameters
There are a number of further, optional parameters, allowing you to enable or
disable certain features of HDClone for the copying process. They are provided
in the form
-[option]:[on|off] or -[option]:[<choice1>|<choice2>|...]
The following table lists the available options. The values printed in capital
letters
(ON or OFF) represents the default value for the respective parameter. This
val-
ue will be used if you do not explicitly provide this parameter. The individual
op-
tions correspond to the options of the graphical HDClone program.
Option Description
-verify:[on|OFF]
Perform an additional verification (49.3 Veriï¬cation).
-smart:[ON|off] Faster copies by using logical file system information

ment variable ERRORLEVEL. This allows to evaluate and to react to the copying
result automatically, for example by using batch files.
Command line interface  69
Option Description
0 Copying process finished successfully with no errors of
any kind or the program was called using parameters
-help or -list.
1 Errors in call (missing/duplicate/invalid parameters).
2 Invalid license or license expired.
3
At least one âresizeâ parameter (410.1.6 Optional pa-
rameters) is invalid, does not match the target size or
contains invalid characters.
4 Could not access source or target properly, for exam-
ple device or file image not found/access denied.
5 Password not specified or invalid password.
6
Cancelled by user ( Ctrl + C ).
7 Copying finished with verification errors.
8 Copying finished with read/write errors (overrides 7).
9 Some other error occurred. A specific error code, is
displayed with the console output of HDClone.
10 Another instance of HDClone is already running.
10.1.8 Resizing
In the case of copying or restoring, you can use the resize option (410.1.6 Op-
tional parameters) to specify how to adjust the sizes of individual partitions
on
the target medium. The resize option without any further parameters will cause
all partitions to be resized proportionally to their original size. You can
specify
one or more additional parameters to specify the resizing for individual
partitions
in their natural order on the medium. These parameters are:
ï±
<size>: Increases or reduces the size of a partition to the size value
specified.
The values may be specified in sectors (S), bytes (B), kilobytes (K), megabytes
(M), gigabytes (G), or terabytes (T). The desired numeric value has to be spec-
ified, immediately followed (without spaces) by one of the unit specifiers
above (for example: 10G = 10 gigabytes or 500M = 500 megabytes).
ï±
ï¬xed: Keeps the partition size without any changes
ï±
skip: Skips the partition, meaning it will not be copied (49.7
PartitionSelect).
ï±
auto: Adjusts the partition size automatically and proportionally to its share
of
the entire medium.
The parameters for resizing (<size>, ï¬xed, skip, auto) may be specified
repeat-
edly, separated by a colon. The parameters will be applied to the partitions in
the
specified order. In the case where there are more partitions than parameters
70  Command line (CLI)
specified, the default parameter auto will be applied to the remaining
partitions.
If there are more parameters specified than partitions available, the remaining
parameters are ignored. This option works similar to 48.4.3 Adjusting
partitions.
Example: There are four partitions on the drive, but only two size values
are specified. The first two partitions will be adjusted as specified. The
two remaining partitions will be resized automatically, just as if the pa-
rameter auto was used for them.
10.1.9 Examples of use
Examples for different use cases are to be found in the CLI subfolder of the
pro-
gram path after installing HDClone, or via Start
â¸ Programs â¸ HDClone... â¸ CLI â¸
Sample scripts
Hint: Call hdclone-cl -list to find out, which drive numbers are assigned
to which physical drives. You will be displayed a list of the available
physical drives in the system.
10.2 Store ï¬nal report
After the process has been finished, you can generate and store a detailed
final
report in a text file to document and analyze the cloning processes. The report
contains the following Information:
{
Program and license
{
Device data (CPU, memory, etc.)
{

11 Troubleshooting
This paragraph describes possible problems when using HDClone and offers pro-
posals for a solution. If there not a proposal given for a solution to a
problem, you
can gladly contact our 413.3 Support.
11.1 General
11.1.1 Retry
In case that something does not run as expected or desired at the first
attempt,
a trivial but often effective solution is to give it a second try. Especially
in case of
hardware issues this saves time, as many problems will be gone when connect-
ing hardware a second time or using a different port.
11.1.2 System-Log
In case of any problems, even if they can be solved with the instructions
follow-
ing, but especially when contacting our 413.3 Support, please create a System
Log first and send it to us. Just like a flight recorder, it contains
information about
program internal activities, which will lead us to a solution much faster â
and you
as well. Store the System Log when HDClone is running as follows:
1. HDClone/S: If you have not booted HDClone from a USB key, please connect
one to store the System Log to.
2. Klick on the Toolbox symbol (48.1.1.2 Toolbox).
3. Select the âStore System Logâ option.
HDClone/S: If you have booted HDClone from a USB key, the System Log will
be stored to it automatically. Otherwise, a popup will open and prompt you to
select a storage medium.
HDClone/W: The System Log will be stored on the Public Desktop. If it is not
visible on your desktop, press
F5  or open the path C:\Users\Public\Desktop
(hidden folder) in Windows Explorer.
4. A popup window appears, showing the storing progress as well as the storage
location and the file name.
If an older System Log is found at the storage location, the number contained
in
the file name will be increased automatically. The latest System Log is always
the
one with the highest number.
72 Troubleshooting
11.2 Create a bootable HDClone medium
This chapter describes potential issues when creating a bootable medium for the
self-booting version of HDClone.
11.2.1 USB key not working
If creating a bootable USB key or booting from this USB key fails, the USB key
may lack a partition table. In this case, use a different USB key instead or
format
the USB key using the HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool (freeware). Download it
at  http://www.miray-software.com/public/tools/HPUSBFW_v2.2.3.exe. After-
wards, start 45.2 Boot-Setup again with this USB key.
11.2.2 CD/DVD writer not selectable
In no drive is offered for selection at CD/DVD writer although a CD/DVD writer
is available on the system, the installed CD/DVD writing software may be the
reason. It may reserve the drive exclusively, so that Boot-Setup cannot access
it.
Deactivate or uninstall the CD/DVD writer software in this case or create a
bootable CD/DVD with your CD/DVD writing software the 45.4 ISO image con-
tained in the software package.
11.3 Booting HDClone
If there are issues when booting HDClone from USB key or CD/DVD (for exam-
ple black screen or startup screen freezes), the following chapters provide
suit-
able solutions.
11.3.2.1 BIOS-USB-Boot
If the HDClone bootable medium (USB key or USB CD/DVD drive) is not listed in
the BBS menu (46.2 Self-booting â HDClone/S), activate USB boot support in
the BIOS setup first. Press
F2 ,  Del , or  F10  (depending on BIOS) to enter
BIOS setup. The setting is to be found under different names and menu items,
depending on the BIOS version. In most cases it is to be found under labels
like
USB, Boot and Legacy. In BIOS setup you can also select to boot from USB per-
manently, usually under the menu item Boot.
11.3.2.2 UEFI-Boot and SecureBoot
Current PC models often have a modern UEFI-BIOS. HDClone supports booting
with UEFI. Some of these BIOSes also offer the SecureBoot function, which is
not
yet supported by HDClone/S for booting. Deactivate SecureBoot while using
Copied disk  73
HDClone/S. You can activate SecureBoot again afterwards. In case there is an
is-
sue when booting with UEFI or SecureBoot, please create the HDClone bootable
medium again (45.2 Boot-Setup). with the âInclude UEFI boot supportâ option
disabled. Start HDClone/S again from this bootable medium.
11.4 Input devices
If there is no reaction on mouse or keyboard input after starting HDClone/S,
the
following subchapters render further information and a solution.
11.4.1 General
A solution that is generally very successful when having issues with input
devices
is to connect an alternative USB input device of the same type.
11.4.2 Bluetooth devices
HDClone/S support USB mice and keyboards (43 Supported hardware). This
also covers many cordless devices, if they are connected as USB devices. Blue-
tooth input devices are currently not supported. In this case, please connect
an
alternative USB device of the same type.
11.4.3 Problem devices
Few USB mice and keyboards contain a flawed implementation of the USB stan-
dard. Those devices may though work with Windows, since vendors usually test
against Windows, but will not work with other operating systems. In this case,
please use a different USB device temporarily. Create a 411.1.2 System-Log
and send it, together with information about vendor and device type of the non-
working device to our 413.3 Support.
11.5 Copied disk
11.5.1 Clone not booting
If the clone (or restored image) of a bootable disk does not boot as expected,
please consider the following notes:
{
Does the source boot correctly? If not, the problem is located here,
{
Ensure that the automatic boot data adjustment (48.4.5 Adjust boot data) is
applied to the target after the copying process has been finished.
{
Is the file system of the source defective? Check this before creating a copy
by running chkdsk /f on the source. Errors on the source file system may yield
74 Troubleshooting
problems on the target, even if the source seems to boot and work correctly.
Otherwise use FullyCopy (47.1.1 Cloning disks) or 47.1.3 BitCopy.
{
Is the disk connected to the target system in the same way as the source in
the original system? In case of an SATA port, a frequent mistake is to have it
configured as AHCI in the BIOS of the first system and as IDE in the other sys-
tem. Some versions of Windows refuse booting then. Change the BIOS setting
as required in this case.
{
Usually, Windows is not able to boot from USB disks. If you have created a
copy of a Windows system to USB, connect the disk as an internal drive before
attempting to boot Windows from it.
11.5.2 Decelerated system
If the performance of the target disk is clearly decreased after cloning or
restor-
ing from an image, the drive may use 4K sectors internally. Create another copy
or restore the disk again and ensure that the 4K alignment option (48.3.4.5 Op-
tions for source and target) is selected for the target disk.
11.6 Copying process
11.6.1 Read, write and veriï¬cation errors
When HDClone reports errors, this usually results from defective areas on the
corresponding disk. General hardware problems can also cause read and write
errors, usually indicated by a very high number of errors. In this case, cancel
the
copying process, connect the affected disk to another port or check if it may
be
defective. Restart the copying process then.
Note: In case of disks connected over USB, use a different USB port and
ensure the power supply is sufficient. When using USB cases for SATA or
IDE hard disks, please check if the case is working properly first.
11.6.2 Copying performance
If the copying performance of HDClone does not achieve the expected value,
please consider the following notes:
{
Does the disk work without an issue? Please use the 47.5.1 SpeedTest func-
tion to check if source and target achieve the expected speed or which of
them probably shows a lack of transfer speed.
{
When using USB cases for SATA and IDE hard disks, please consider that the
maximum transfer speed is much lower for USB 2 than for SATA or IDE.
Mass storage  75
{
When using USB3 devices, ensure that they are connected to a USB 3 con-
nector (blue). In fact USB3 devices are downward-compatible, but only run at
USB2 speed when plugged to a USB2 connector (black).
{
Also consider that creating a SmartCopy or images will usually not achieve the
nominal transfer speed of a FullCopy or BitCopy. This has technical reasons
and therefore is normal.
11.7 Mass storage
Please ensure that the disks are working properly and connected correctly. Also
take care that the power supply is sufficient. The following subchapters
contain
information about certain types of storage media.
11.7.1 SCSI
When using SCSI devices, please ensure that they are configured correctly and
connected to one of the supported SCSI controllers. A list of supported SCSI
controllers is to be found at 43.3 Compatibility.
HDClone supports even more controllers, either as onboard chipset (AIC) or as
addon card (AHA, ASC). They are determinable by their respective vendor and
device IDs which are listed in the following table.

76 Troubleshooting
11.8 USB
11.8.1 Hubs
USB devices can either be connected directly or over a USB hub. In order to
achieve as high transfer rates as possible, it is recommended to connect them
directly to the PC or the USB controller.
11.8.2 USB 3
Always ensure that you connect USB3 devices to a proper USB3 connector
(blue) in order to utilize the full performance of USB3.
11.9 Mapped network drives
When using mapped drives in Windows, HDClone may not find the mapped
drives in some cases, since HDClone is running in administrator mode. To use
the
established mapped drives, a small change to the Windows Registry is required.
Usually, 45.2 Boot-Setup will handle this automatically. But you can also make
the change manually, as described below:
{
Open the registry editor (regedit.exe)
{
Move to the following registry key in the tree structure
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
Policies\System
{
Create the DWORD value EnableLinkedConnections
{
Set its value data to 1 and restart your computer
Note: To undo the changes, simply delete the registry value.
Program startup  77
12 Miray Virtual Disk
HDClone contains the Miray Virtual Disk software, which allows to mount file
im-
ages created with HDClone â even VMDK, VHD/VHDX, VDI images â as virtual
Windows drives. You can then access files and folders stored within a file
image
directly. Miray Virtual Disk can be started on demand or automatically at
system
start-up. File images may be mounted either just on demand or persistently.
Note: You can also open and mount file images as virtual drives directly,
from the network, using network drives or network shares.
12.1 Installation
Miray Virtual Disk is included with the 45.2 Boot-Setup. During setup (45.1
Setup for Windows), you can choose to install Miray Virtual Disk. It will be
in-
stalled to a separate location in the Program Files directory.
12.2 Program startup
You will find Miray Virtual Disk in the Windows Start menu in the HDClone fold-
er. At startup, the program window will appear (4ï¬g.î50). Since Miray
Virtual
Disk works in the background, the program icon will appear in the System Tray.
Miray Virtual Disk will remain active in the background, even if you close the
program window. You can open the program window again using the System
Tray icon.
12.2.1 Program window
Use the program window
(4ï¬g.î 50), to open file images
and create virtual drives. It con-
tains three major elements: menu
bar, 412.2.2 Image list, and con-
trol buttons at the bottom. You
may also control Miray Virtual
Disk using the Context Menu
(right click on the image list) or
keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys)
(412.3 Operation).
ï¬g.î50: Program window
78  Miray Virtual Disk
You can use the control buttons to add an Image (Add..., see 412.3.1 Adding an
image) to or to remove an Image (Remove
, see 412.3.2 Removing an image)
from the image list. Press OK
to close the program window. Miray Virtual Disk will
continue to stay active in the background (412.2.3 Tray icon).
Note: Adding an image to the image list does not automatically create
a virtual drive. The image list shows the partitions an image contains, so
you can mount them separately (412.3.4 Mounting an image).
Hint: If you have several images in the list, you may want to resize the
program window freely by clicking and dragging the lower right corner.
12.2.2 Image list
The image list serves to manage the images added before and offers an over-
view of the partitions they may contain. Partitions are always displayed right
be-
low the image they belong to. To distinguish the individual entries in the
image
list, there are different symbols as listed below:
File image
Image is not mounted
File image
Image could not be found
File image
Image is mounted
File image
Image is mounted perma-
nently
SuperFloppy (no MBR)
Volume is not mounted
Partition
Partition is not mounted
SuperFloppy (no MBR)
Volume is mounted
Partition
Partition is mounted
SuperFloppy (no MBR)
Volume is mounted perma-
nently
Partition
Partition is mounted perma-
nently
Operation 79
Note: In addition to the symbols listed above, there is a column Status,
where a mounted image or volume will be marked with letter M or - if
permanently mounted - with MP.
Hint: You can directly open mounted partitions in Windows Explorer by
double-clicking in the File image column. This may be especially useful,
if there is no drive letter available to be assigned to the partition.
12.2.3 Tray icon
You can see whether Miray Virtual Disk is ac-
tive or not from the program icon appearing in
the System Tray (Tray icon). You can open the
program window by double-clicking the Tray
icon. Right-clicking the Tray icon opens the con-
text menu (4ï¬g.î51) which gives you direct ac-
cess to the following four functions:
{
Autostart: Same functions as 412.3.7 Autostart.
{
Add image: Same functions as 412.3.1 Adding an image.
{
Open program window: Opens the program window or brings it to the front.
{
Quit Miray Virtual Disk: Same functions as 412.3.9 Quit program.
Hint: If you want to open the program window, double-click the Tray
icon. If the Tray icon is not visible, Miray Virtual Disk is not active and
there are no virtual drives available.
12.3 Operation
You can operate Miray Virtual Disk using the menu bar on the top of the win-
dow, the control buttons on the bottom of the window or the context menu
(412.2.1 Program window).The context menu opens by right-clicking on entries
or on the free area of the image list. You open the tray context menu by a
right-
click on the program icon in the System Tray.
12.3.1 Adding an image
At first, you can add a file image to the image list of the program window.
There
are six ways to achieve this:
{
Control button Add...
{
Menu bar File â¸ Add image...
ï¬g.î51: Tray icon and context
menu
80  Miray Virtual Disk
{
Context menu Add image...
{
Tray context menu Add image...
{
Hotkey  F2
{
Drag-and-drop from any Explorer window
The image list also displays information on the partitions and file systems of
each
file image in the list (4ï¬g.î50).
Note: Depending on the version of the program, you will be allowed to
add one or more images. When you quit the program, Miray Virtual
Disk will memorize these images for the next program startup.
12.3.2 Removing an image
Select one or more file images that you want to remove from the image list.
There are four ways to remove them:
{
Control button Remove
{
Menu bar File â¸ Remove image
{
Context menu Remove image
{
Hotkey  Shift + F2
Note: If images or individual partitions you want to remove are still
mounted as virtual drives, the file image cannot be removed. A corre-
sponding message will appear.
12.3.3 Empty image list
There are three ways to remove all images from the image list:
{
Menu bar File â¸ Empty image list
{
Context menu Empty image list
{
Hotkey  Ctrl + Shift + F2
Note: If one or more file images to be removed from the image list (or
individual partitions thereof) are still mounted as virtual drives, the im-
age list cannot be emptied.
12.3.4 Mounting an image
You can mount previously added file images or individual data areas (volumes)
as Windows drives. When mounting an image, it will be made available as a Win-
Operation 81
dows disk and will behave just like a physical disk. When mounting an entire
file
image which contains several partitions, you obtain several drive letters, one
for
each partition containing a file system Windows is able to access. When mount-
ing an individual partition, you may obtain one drive letter for this partition
if
Windows supports the file system it contains.
There are three ways to mount an entire file image or an individual partition.
Se-
lect one or more images or partitions first:
{
Menu bar Image â¸ Mount
{
Context menu Mount image
{
Hotkey  F8
As soon as an image or a partition has been mounted successfully, this will be
displayed in the image list as follows:
{
The icon of the image or partition mounted will be displayed in color.
{
The capital M is displayed in the column next to the icon.
{
The drive letter(s) assigned to the virtual drives will be displayed in the row
of
the mounted image or partition.
Note: The capital M always appears in the row of the object which has
actually been mounted. For example, mounting an image containing
two partitions, M will appear in the row of the image. If mounting both
partitions individually, the capital M appears in both partition rows.
12.3.5 Persistent mounting
You can make mounted virtual drives persistent. This means that these virtual
drivers will be mounted automatically with any start of Miray Virtual Disk.
They
will remain mounted as long as the program is active. In case this feature is
used
in combination with the option 412.3.7 Autostart, the respective virtual drives
will be available at any time while Windows is running.
Note: Password protected images cannot be mounted permanently,
since the password would have to be stored. This would compromise
password security and therefor is not supported.
If you want to mount images or partitions permanently, there are three ways to
achieve this. Select one or more images or partitions first:
{
Menu bar Image â¸ Mount permanently
{
Context menu Mount image permanently / Mount volume permanently
(right-click on the desired image or partition in the image list)
82  Miray Virtual Disk
{
Hotkey  Ctrl + F8
Persistent mounting can be applied to mounted and unmounted images or parti-
tions. As soon as an image or a partition has been successfully mounted persis-
tently, this will be displayed in the image list as follows:
{
A small green point   appears in the icon of the mounted image/partition.
{
The capitals MP are displayed in the column next to the icon
Note: To cancel persistent mounting, mount the regarding image or
partition normally (412.3.4 Mounting an image) or unmount it com-
pletely (412.3.6 Drive unmounting).
12.3.6 Drive unmounting
There are three ways mounted images and partitions and the regarding virtual
drives can be unmounted. Select one or more images or partitions first:
{
Menu bar Image â¸ Unmount
{
Context menu Unmount image / Unmount volume
{
Hotkey  Shift + F8
As soon as an image or an individual partition have been unmounted, the re-
spective icon in the image list will be displayed in gray and the capitals M or
MP
in the column next to the icon as well as the related drive letters will
disappear.
12.3.7 Autostart
You can select to start Miray Virtual Disk automatically at system startup
(Auto-
start). This allows you to have persistently mounted drives permanently
available
without having to start Miray Virtual Disk manually.
There are two ways to switch the Autostart function on or off:
{
Menu bar Image â¸ Autostart
{
Tray context menu Autostart
The menu item indicates whether the Autostart function is currently active. If
the
menu item Autostart
is displayed with a leading check mark, the Autostart func-
tion is already activated. Without a check mark, the Autostart function is not
ac-
tive.
Note: If Miray Virtual Disk is started automatically at system startup,
only the 412.2.3 Tray icon will appear. Double-click it to open the pro-
gram window.
Modes of operation  83
12.3.8 Close program window
You can close the program window at any time. Miray Virtual Disk will continue
to stay active in the background. There are two ways to close the window:
{
Menu bar File â¸ Close window
{
Hotkey  Ctrl + W
12.3.9 Quit program
To quit Miray Virtual Disk completely, there are three ways:
{
Menu bar File â¸ Quit Miray Virtual Disk
{
Tray context menu Quit Miray Virtual Disk
{
Hotkey  Ctrl + Q
Note: When quitting Miray Virtual Disk, all active virtual drives will be
unmounted after a corresponding popup has been confirmed. They will
be unavailable until next program startup.
12.4 Drive not visible
If there are no drive letters or less drive letters than partitions displayed
after
mounting an image, there may be several reasons:
{
Windows drive recognition of one or more virtual drives has been delayed. In
this case, they have a drive letter assigned, but Miray Virtual Disk does not
display it yet. Press the
F5  key or select Image â¸ Refresh list from the main
menu to update the image list.
{
One or more partitions contain file systems Windows is unable to use (e.g.
Linux file systems). In this case, the behavior is normal, since Windows is not
able to use these file systems.
{
There are no more Windows drive letters available. Windows recognizes the
mounted partitions, but cannot assign drive letters to them. In this case, free
one or more of the drive letters currently in use.
{
If there is a drive letter displayed, but the drive has no content or Windows
prompts to format that drive, the file system is damaged. The image may have
been created from an inconsistent or damaged file system.
12.5 Modes of operation
There are three different ways to mount file images in Miray Virtual Disk:
84  Miray Virtual Disk
{
Write-protected: Menu bar Image â¸ Advanced â¸ Mount (R/O)
{
Writeable with undo option: Menu bar Image â¸ Mount
{
Direct reading & writing: Menu bar Image â¸ Advanced â¸ Mount (R/W)
12.5.1 Write-protected access
In this mode, virtual drives can only be read. In previous versions of Miray
Vir-
tual Disk, this was the only mode available. In this mode, no changes are made
to the mounted images and no changes can be made to the file system on the
virtual drive. For example, it is not possible to change file names or access
rights
in this mode.
12.5.2 Read/write access (default)
This mode is the default mode when mounting file images. It allows to read from
and write to file images. The data written will be stored separately in this
mode.
This means that the data of the original file image remains unaltered, even
when
writing to the virtual drive. To make changes available in the original image,
some
Editions of HDClone allow to create a new image of the desired type from the
virtual drive (412.7 Copy to other Image formats)
Note: This mode works with any kind of file image. For high perfor-
mance access, it is recommended to use RAW images (412.6 Convert-
ing to RAW image) in R/W mode (412.5.3 Direct read/write access).
To undo changes to an original image, resulting from write access to it, select
the
image in the list and unmount it. Then click on Extras
â¸ Delete overlay data. The
file image then has been reverted to its original state. Any changes made to
the
virtual drive are then made undone.
Hint: To delete overlay data created with Miray Virtual Disk 3.x and ear-
lier, double-click the file image in Windows Explorer and delete any files
with the .ovl extension there.
12.5.3 Direct read/write access
In this mode Miray Virtual Disk writes or reads directly from a RAW image. It
of-
fers the fastest possible access â comparable to physical media access. This
mode will immediately and irrevocably change the RAW image â in contrast to
normal read/write access (412.5.2 Read/write access (default)). Therefore you
may consider creating a copy of the original RAW image before using direct
read/write access.
Copy to other Image formats  85
Note: This mode can only be applied to RAW images. If required, you
can convert other image types into RAW images (412.6 Converting to
RAW image).
12.6 Converting to RAW image
One main advantage of SmartImages is the greatly reduced size they require for
storing. When using Miray Virtual Disk, RAW images offer a clearly higher
access
performance of the virtual drive. If required, you can convert a SmartImage to
a
RAW image via Extra
â¸ Create RAM image....
12.7 Copy to other Image formats
Use HDClone to create a copy of a virtual drive into a new image of any format
required (Full, Smart, RAW, VMDK, VHD), independent of the original image for-
mat the virtual drive is based on.
Especially in cases where an image has been mounted with 412.5.2 Read/write
access (default), the changes made on the virtual drive are not stored in the
original image. In this case, you can use such a copy to create a new image of
the desired type, which will then contain all changes made to the virtual
drive.
