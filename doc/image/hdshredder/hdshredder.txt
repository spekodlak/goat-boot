1.3  Features
HDShredder allows you to delete entire hard disks or other storage media as
well
as individual partitions securely and irrevocably, according to international
stan-
dards, if desired. The data once deleted cannot be recovered with data recov-
ery software either. HDShredder deletes hard disks regardless of their
partition-
ing scheme, file system(s), and operating system(s). With the deletion
standards
supported, HDShredder provides highest security as well as a high level of
flexi-
bility by offering free definition of your own deletion patterns. This makes
HDShredder particularly suitable for the tasks mentioned in 42 Fields of
applica-
tion as well as for many other tasks.

12  Fields of application
2  Fields of application
HDShredder is specialized on deleting entire hard disks and other media or
indi-
vidual partitions easily and fast but also securely, i.e. finally. The data
storage me-
dia remain fully usable after the deletion. The deletion is irreversible on the
phys-
ical level. HDShredder thus provides special advantages when deleting damaged
media (42.9 Damaged storage media). Furthermore, HDShredder works inde-
pendently of partition scheme, data system, and operating system, if needed.
You thus also have the possibility to delete complete operating system
installa-
tions in one go (42.5 Deleting the software installation) or to perform a
secure
deletion in case of unknown/proprietary file systems (42.8 Proprietary hard
disk
formats). All in all, the universal HDShredder deletion procedure covers a
broad
range of areas of application. Hereafter, you will find descriptions of the
most
common applications of HDShredder. The individual chapters offer an instruc-
tion and further tips for execution.
Hint: HDShredder also allows you to delete data from media (e.g. hard
disks) which have not been used in a PC (42.10 Arbitrary computer
systems).
Note: Media which have been deleted with HDShredder are further on
fully operational and usable. The deletion with HDShredder does not
damage or destroy the media in contrast to mechanical or physical de-
letion procedures.
2.1  Deletion of data
Generally, the deletion of data constitutes the main area of application of
HDShredder. Select one of the higher standards for the secure deletion of data
(45.8.2 Standards) or an individually defined deletion pattern (45.8.3 Custom).
A deletion report, which can be created optionally after a deletion process,
pro-
vides information about the parameters and the result of the deletion. This re-
port can also be used for customers and principals as a confirmation of the
com-
pleted deletion.
Note: Media deleted by HDShredder are further fully usable after the
deletion. The deletion does not damage the media themselves. Only a
new formatting (and partitioning, if needed) is necessary to use the me-
dia again. However, a reconstruction of data once deleted with
HDShredder â also unintentionally â is not possible.
Removing viruses  13
2.2  Disposal of computers
In case you give away computers for purposes of a final disposal, the deletion
of
the integrated hard disk(s) is recommended anyway. Otherwise, third persons
are easily able to view your data. With HDShredder, a deletion is no problem
because inoperative operating systems or defective media do not constitute a
problem either and a deletion using HDShredder is still possible. This also
applies,
of course, for the disposal of individual or external storage devices.
2.3  Sale of computers
Before selling a used computer or used hard disks, you should make sure that
per-
sonal data and other sensitive data cannot be viewed or recovered by the buyer.
HDShredder
allows you to delete the entire drive (4
6.1.2 Deleting an entire
drive
) or a single partition (4
6.1.3 Deleting a single partition
) fast and securely.
2.4  Passing on of computers
Also in case computers or data storage media are passed on within a company
or an organization, it is desirable that no sensitive data are available on
them any
more. In contrast to mechanical or physical deletion procedure, HDShredder of-
fers the advantage to further use the deleted media after the deletion.
2.5  Deleting the software installation
In some cases, it may be useful to not only delete the data but also the
software
and the operating system installed. If this involves commercial software, you
want
to continue to use, the installations then available could be considered as
pirate
copies.
HDShredder
allows you to make sure that no one can use your software
licenses unauthorized when selling or passing on used computers or hard disks.
2.6  Deleting photos and videos
When passing on or disposing mobile storage media, especially flash storage
cards for digital cameras and video recorders, it is often forgotten that the
pic-
tures thereon or other data could come into the wrong hands. HDShredder al-
lows you to delete these media easily and securely.
2.7  Removing viruses
Although HDShredder is not an anti virus software: some viruses are so
persistent
that they hide in usually inaccessible areas of the hard disk (boot sector,
MBR,
unpartitioned areas). In this case, a complete deletion of the hard disk with
14  Fields of application
HDShredder and a subsequent new installation may not be the most elegant but
certainly one of the most reliable solutions to finally delete damaging
programs
from your hard disks.
2.8  Proprietary hard disk formats
HDShredder deletes entire drives or individual partitions regardless of the
file or
operating system thereon. That is why HDShredder allows you to delete any
drive or partition regardless of the software or file systems installed
thereon. The
deletion of proprietary or rare formats is also no problem.
2.9  Damaged storage media
Damaged storage media are often simply disposed without further measures af-
ter the data recovery because they are âdefectiveâ. However, just as you
third
persons may be able to recover great parts of the data with the help of data
re-
covery software. That is why you should delete defective storage media with
HDShredder as well â of course only after a possible data recovery.
Note: HDShredder also runs on media with defective sectors. In this
case, it simply overwrites all sectors which can still be written. The other
defective sectors cannot be read any more anyway.
2.10 Arbitrary computer systems
HDShredder cannot only be used on PC systems. Many special systems, e.g. in
industry and medicine, are principally PC compatible as well. In this case,
HDShredder can be directly used on the concerned system. Thanks to its oper-
ating system independence, it does not have to work with the operating system
installed on the system. Therefore, you can use HDShredder on arbitrary, PC
compatible systems to delete the data thereon easily and finally.
Hint: HDShredder can also be useful for special systems which are not
PC compatible. Most of such systems use internal IDE, SCSI, or SATA hard
disks or flash storage media. You can then simply install them in a PC and
delete them there, in case HDShredder does not run directly on the
concerned special system.

3.2  Compatibility
HDShredder has been developed for the hardware listed in 43.1 Overview and
tested on a huge number of devices. It also works with many other devices.
Please use the HDShredder Free Edition to easily check out in advance and for
free whether the device in question is supported (43.2.1 Compatibility test).
3.2.1  Compatibility test
You can use the Free Edition of HDShredder to easily check if your hard disks
and
other media are supported properly, even if a higher edition is required to use
them with HDShredder. For this purpose, simply start HDShredder Free Edition
on the respective PC, chose drive deletion and move on to the drive selection
screen (45.6 Selecting the deletion area). All drives displayed there as well
as
the associated controllers have been recognized by HDShredder and are sup-
ported by one of the available editions. Which edition will be necessary to
utilize
a certain device type can be seen from the info box at the right side of the
list
box when you select the regarding drive (45.7.4 Drive information).
Note: Please ensure that you connect the needed USB devices before
starting the program to ensure that they are recognized correctly
(45.1 Preliminary steps).
3.2.2  Standards
To be able to support as many devices as possible, HDShredder implements the
effective standards for the appropriate device types. Device support in
HDShredder primarily refers to the standards applicable to the appropriate de-
vice type. In addition, we perform extensive tests with each device type. Those
tests also reveal that there is a number of devices, which themselves implement
their respective standard only insufficiently or even inaccurately.
Furthermore, it
is possible that some problems occur in certain hardware configurations,
usually
IDE/ATA/SATA 17
in certain combinations of controller and device. If possible, HDShredder tries
to
support even such devices and to bypass the any hardware deficiencies. How-
ever, these kinds of problems can not always be bypassed. Even extensive tests
cannot completely prevent problems with your special hardware configuration.
In most cases this can be solved by setting the options appropriately (45.9 Se-
lecting the options and 47 Troubleshooting). If this does not work, our support
team (48.5 Support) will be there to assist you with solving the problem.
3.3  IDE/ATA/SATA
Generally, HDShredder supports IDE/ATA/SATA hard disks. They have to be con-
nected to one of the IDE/ATA/SATA controllers supported by HDShredder
(43.3.1 IDE/ATA controllers and 43.3.2 SATA/SATA-II controllers).
3.3.1  IDE/ATA controllers
HDShredder supports standard IDE controller (ISA) and PCI IDE controller. These
may be (internal) onboard controllers as well as (external) PCI/ISA adapter
cards.
In case of ISA/Standard IDE controllers, the first two channels are scanned for
hard disks. HDShredder recognizes available PCI IDE controllers automatically
and scans them for connected hard disks.
Note: If there are one or more PCI IDE controllers available in the sys-
tem, ISA controllers that are possibly present, too, will not be taken into
account and drives connected to them will not be listed.
HDShredder supporting PCI IDE controllers refers to a standardized program-
ming interface, which is supported by most IDE controllers. Use the 43.2.1
Compatibility test to check if your PCI controller complies with PCI IDE
standard.
3.3.2  SATA/SATA-II controllers
Precondition for the support of SATA drives is an SATA controller with IDE
inter-
face or an SATA II controller with AHCI interface. All popular chipsets from
Intel
with ICH-5/-6/-7 incorporate such an IDE-compatible SATA controller. Neverthe-
less, it may be possible in case of onboard SATA controllers to activate a
compat-
ibility mode in BIOS setup, which would allow HDShredder to access the SATA
controller. As for SATA II controllers, many models already implement the AHCI
interface supported by HDShredder.
Hint:
With
HDShredder
Free Edition you can easily check out if your SATA
or SATA-II controller is supported (43.2.1 Compatibility test). Connect at
least one SATA drive and start
HDShredder
. If the SATA drive is recognized,
HDShredder
also supports the associated SATA/SATA-II controller.
18  Supported hardware
Note: It might be necessary to adjust the SATA settings in BIOS. As mode
of operation, IDE, ATA, compatible or AHCI should be chosen, but in no
case RAID or SATA. Additionally it may be necessary to set the control-
ler configuration to combined, especially for allowing simultaneous use
of IDE and SATA hard disks. In this case there are only ports 0 and 2 or
1 and 3 available for SATA. Please connect the SATA hard disks corre-
spondingly in this case.
3.3.3  Multiword DMA and Ultra-DMA
HDShredder automatically recognizes and uses bus master IDE controllers,
which allow data rates up to 133îMB/sec resp. 7.8îGB/min. Hereby, Multiword
DMA (up to 16.7îMB/sec) as well as Ultra-DMA (UDMA) are supported. This can
increase achievable data transmission rates by a multiple higher of the rates
that
can be achieved without DMA (in PIO mode). HDShredder recognizes automat-
ically whether controller and hard disk support DMA and then automatically se-
lects the fastest usable mode (Multiword DMA or Ultra-DMA 33/66/100/133).
Note: Please take into account that both, hard disk and IDE controller
have to support a certain DMA mode. If the actual speed does not
match the technical data of a hard disk, the reason may be that the IDE
controller only supports lower modes. Furthermore, the achievable val-
ues also depend on the physical abilities of the hard disk, i.e. a hard disk
with UDMA-6 (theoretically 133îMB/sec.) currently achieves an actual
transfer rate of about 90îMB/sec.
3.3.4  Bus master IDE controllers
Precondition for using DMA mode is that the attached PCI IDE controller also
supports the Bus master IDE standard. This is the case for most of the
established
internal and external IDE controllers. Whether your PCI IDE controller supports
Bus master IDE can be determined by means of the program PCISniffer, if neces-
sary, which can be downloaded for free at http://www.miray.de/download/sat.
pcisniffer.html. The field âClasscodeâ in PCISniffer has to contain the
value 01018x
(xî=îarbitrary) for the respective PCI IDE controller.
Note: For using Bus master IDE, the settings and initializations made in
and by the PCâs system BIOS play a major role. In case of problems with
utilizing DMA, it is likely that certain BIOS settings have to be accommo-
dated correspondingly (47.4.3 Problems with DMA).
SCSI 19
3.3.5  Speed
The speed DMA can achieve always depends on the physical abilities of a hard
disk. The rough classification below shows the approximate speed to be expect-
ed from a certain drive type:
Type Age Speed
Older drives About 5-10 years About 5-30 MB/sec
Newer drives About 2-5 years About 30-60 MB/sec.
Top models About 0-2 years About 60-120 MB/sec and more
SSDs About 0-2 years About 90-200 MB/sec and more
3.4  SCSI
If your edition of HDShredder supports SCSI hard disks, the following chapters
provide important information on utilizing and compatibility of SCSI devices.
Note: Since HDShredder embeds original driver code of the hardware
manufacturers, there no influence on actual compatibility. The follow-
ing information is based on specifications of the manufacturer.
3.4.1  Utilization
You can use HDShredder with SCSI hard disk in the same way as with any other
media.  HDShredder automatically recognizes supported SCSI controllers and
connected SCSI hard disks at program start and displays them, along with other
recognized media, in the respective selection lists.
3.4.2  Compatibility
Generally, HDShredder supports SCSI hard disk drives. As a precondition, they
have to be connected to a SCSI controller HDShredder supports. Currently,
HDShredder supports Narrow-, Wide-, Ultra- and Ultra-Wide-SCSI controllers
from Adaptec.
Hint:
You can determine whether your SCSI controller is supported with
any edition of
HDShredder
(43.2.1 Compatibility test).
If HDShredder
recognizes the SCSI drive, it will also support the SCSI controller
.

The IDs of your controller can be determined by PCISniffer. It can be download-
ed for free at http://www.miray.de/download/sat.pcisniffer.html. For the SCSI
controller in question, the values displayed by PCISniffer for the fields
Vendor ID
and Device ID have to match the values specified above for your SCSI
controller.
3.5  USB
If your edition of HDShredder also supports USB storage media, the following
chapters contain information regarding utilization and compatibility of USB
stor-
age media and controllers.
Firewire (IEEE1394)  21
Note: Please take care to connect USB devices already before starting
HDShredder (45.1 Preliminary steps) and if possible directly to the PC
resp. to the USB controller (43.5.4 Hubs).
3.5.1  Mass-Storage-Class
USB storage media that is intended to be used with HDShredder has to support
the USB-Mass-Storage-Class protocol. This is an official standard, which is
sup-
ported by almost all current USB sticks, USB card readers, USB hard disks etc.
If
you are not sure if a certain USB storage medium is supported by HDShredder,
you can check this out easily and for free in advance by means of the Free Edi-
tion (43.2.1 Compatibility test).
3.5.2  UHCI, OHCI and EHCI
In case of USB devices, it is crucial that HDShredder supports the USB
controller
used. HDShredder is capable of all four common USB standards, UHCI and OHCI
for USB 1.0/1.1, EHCI for USB 2.0 as well as XHCI for USB 3.0. In the area of
stan-
dard PCs, all USB controllers, onboard controllers as well as adapter cards,
offer
one of these four interface standards. In case you are not sure though, you can
use HDShredder Free Edition to check (43.2.1 Compatibility test).
3.5.3  XHCI
HDShredder also supports the new XHCI standard. Therefore it is able to use
fast,
state-of-the-art USB 3.0 SuperSpeed technology mass storage media.
3.5.4  Hubs
USB devices are sometimes connected via a USB hub. To achieve the highest
possible sped, we recommend to connect USB disks directly to the PCâs USB
port.
3.6  Firewire (IEEE1394)
If your edition of HDShredder supports Firewire, you can connect arbitrary
Firewire drives or card readers. Connected devices must support the Serial-Bus-
Protocol (SBP) in order to be recognized and operated correctly by HDShredder.
Note: Please take care to connect Firewire devices already before start-
ing HDShredder (45.1 Preliminary steps) and if possible directly to the
PC or to the Firewire controller.
22 Installation
4  Installation
4.1  Introduction
HDShredder can be started without an installation directly in Windows or with-
out the presence of an operating system as a self-booting application from CD,
floppy disk or USB key (44.1.1 Bootable medium). Additionally, there is a setup
program for installing HDShredder in Windows (44.2.1 HDShredder Setup).
4.1.1  Bootable medium
In case you have HDShredder already available on a bootable medium, you can
start and use the program immediately on any PC and without any preceding
installation, as described in chapter 45.2 Starting the program.
Note: It is possible that, although you have HDShredder on a physical
medium, it may not be in form of a bootable medium but rather as an
installation package. Create a bootable medium at first, according to
the following description (44.1.2 Software package).
4.1.2  Software package
If you have not received HDShredder on a bootable medium, you can create
one by yourself. The software package contains the required files. The
following
chapters describe how to create a bootable medium. It can be used to start
HDShredder without any installation (45.2 Starting the program).
4.2  Installation in Windows
The HDShredder package contains a
setup program (setup.exe), allowing
you to install HDShredder directly on
Windows into a program folder. This
will â by choice of the user â also cre-
ate an Start menu folder as well as links
on your desktop and in the Quickstart
bar (44.2.1 HDShredder Setup).
The  HDShredder software package
also contains an installation program for
ï¬g.î1: HDShredder setup start screen
Installation in Windows  23
creating a bootable floppy disk or CD/DVD with only few mouse clicks (44.2.2
Boot-Setup & Emergency Medium). To use the boot setup program, please run
setup.exe first. Then start [All Programs] â¸ [HDShredder]  â¸ [Create
bootable
medium] in the Windows Start menu.
Note: Alternatively, in case you have a software package in the ZIP file
format, you may extract all files to an empty folder. Then execute the
file setup.exe from there.
4.2.1  HDShredder Setup
Start setup.exe (4ï¬g.î1) and select the desired options on the first
screen. Then
follow the instructions displayed to install HDShredder on your Windows PC. Af-
ter setup has finished, you are asked in the final screen to choose whether to
start HDShredder directly.
Note: If you received
HDShredder
on a physical medium, you may ad-
ditionally use setup.exe to install
HDShredder
on Windows. A software
package in the ZIP file format has to be un-zipped first. In case you have
downloaded the setup.exe file (selfextracting), please start it directly.
4.2.2  Boot-Setup & Emergency Medium
When starting the Boot-Setup program
the main window appears (4ï¬g.î2).
{
If you want to create a bootable
floppy, choose the drive at Floppy
drive and click on [Create ï¬oppy].
{
To create a bootable CD/DVD,
choose the drive at CD/DVD writer
and click on [Create CD/DVD].
{
To create a bootable USB key,
choose the drive at USB medium
and click on [Make bootable].
Follow the instructions and wait until
the installation program reports suc-
cessful creation of the bootable medi-
um. Then click on [Exit]. Afterwards,
please proceed with chapter 45 Pro-
gram instructions.

boot setup
24 Installation
Note: When creating a CD/DVD, please always use a new, empty
writeable CD/DVD. Otherwise there may be problems when starting
HDShredder.
4.2.2.1  CD/DVD writer not selectable
In few cases, no drive is offered for selection at CD/DVD writer although a CD/
DVD writer is available on the system. Usually, this results from already
installed
software for the CD/DVD writer (e.g. drivers for direct access to the CD/DVD
writer with Windows Explorer). It reserves the drive in a way that the
installation
program cannot access it. If possible, deactivate or uninstall the CD/DVD
writer
software. Or create a bootable CD/DVD from that ISO image, which is also con-
tained in the software package (44.3.2 Creating a bootable CD/DVD).
4.2.3  Bootable Windows XP CD
When using HDShredder with storage devices or controllers, which require spe-
cial Windows drivers, it has to be used directly on Windows. If there is no
Win-
dows installation available, you can create a bootable Windows XP CD which
includes the drivers needed. It just requires PE Builder and a Windows XP
instal-
lation CD.
Please download PE Builder from the
Internet at http://www.nu2.nu/pebuild-
er/. The downloaded package allows
you to create a specially configured
Windows XP system, which can be
started right off a CD. A plug-in is used
to integrate HDShredder into the PE
system. A corresponding plug-in is to
be found at http://www.miray.de/pub-
lic/support/HDShredder-BartPE-Plugin.
en.zip. Please install PE Builder on your
system and unpack the plug-in to the
folder  pebuilder3110a\plugin. This lo-
cation then should contain the new folder HDShredder. Now copy hdshredder.
exe from the installation package to pebuilder3110a\plugin\HDShredder\ï¬les.
In case the mass storage devices and controller on your target system will re-
quire special drivers, please copy the driver files to
pebuilder3110a\drivers\SC-
SIAdapter.
Then start pebuilder.exe from the folder pebuilder3110a. After few seconds, a
ï¬g.î3: PE Builder conï¬guration dialog
Installation with other operating systems  25
dialog window appears (4ï¬g.î3). Please enter the path to the Windows XP
instal-
lation files in the input field on top. They are to be found on your Windows XP
installation CD. Hence, this field usually contains the drive letter of your
CD/DVD
drive â except you have copied the installation files to another location.
You can
now choose a name and a location for the boot image by clicking on Create ISO
image in the box Media output. If another CD/DVD writer is available, you can
immediately create a CD by clicking on Burn to CD/DVD. Otherwise, please cre-
ate an ISO image first.
After clicking on Start PE Builder creates the CD. Depending on your system,
this
may take a few minutes. If you did not select Burn to CD/DVD in the previous
step, it is necessary to write the newly created ISO image to CD with your re-
cording software. Please note that the file has to be written to CD directly as
an
image. Normal writing will not be sufficient in this case. Instead, please
start your
recording software and choose Create from image file (or similar description,
depending on the recording software used).
Start your PC from the CD created. HDShredder is to be found at Go â¸
Programs.
4.3  Installation with other operating systems
4.3.1  Creating a bootable ï¬oppy disk
You can also create a bootable HDShredder floppy disk without the installation
program with any operating system. For this purpose, the HDShredder software
package contains a floppy disk image in the file hdshredder.img. You can create
a bootable 3.5â/1.44MB floppy disk from this image with any appropriate disk
imaging program. After having created a bootable floppy disk, you can start
HDShredder on any PC as described in chapter 45.2 Starting the program.
Hint: Under UNIX and Linux you may use the tool dd, which is available
on these systems, with the following syntax:
dd if=hdshredder.img of=/dev/fd0.
4.3.2  Creating a bootable CD/DVD
The HDShredder software package contains an ISO image (hdshredder.iso). It
can be used to create a bootable HDShredder-CD in any operating system and
with any software supporting creation of CDs/DVDs from ISO images. Further
information can be found in the manual of your CD/DVD authoring software..
{
Extract the file hdshredder.iso from the HDShredder software package.
{
Start your CD writing software and choose Create CD from image file (or sim-
ilar caption, according to the respective CD writing software)
26 Installation
{
Specify the file hdshredder.iso as image file.
{
Insert a blank CD into the drive and write the CD.
Hint: The easiest way of creating a bootable HDShredder CD under
Linux is using the software tool cdrecord with the following syntax:
cdrecord hdshredder.iso.
After having accomplished these steps you have created a bootable HDShredder
CD. From this CD you can start HDShredder directly on any PC with a bootable
CD/DVD drive as described in 45.2 Starting the program.
Note: CD/DVD writing software may refuse writing an ISO image to a
DVD. The HDShredder installation program writes DVDs without any
problem. Booting from a DVD created this way also works smoothly.
4.4  Booting from USB key
To start HDShredder from a USB key, the PC has to be able to boot from USB
media. Usually the easiest way is to enter the BIOS-Boot-Selector (BBS) and se-
lect the USB key to start from. The PC then boots directly from the USB key in-
stead of the installed operating system. Depending on the regarding BIOS of the
PC, the USB key is displayed in the BBS menu under its name (e.g. Miray USB),
as
USB medium, USB-HDD, Removable Device, or a similar caption.
If the USB key is not listed in the BBS menu at all, it is required to activate
support
for USB boot media in the BIOS setup first. This setting is to be found under
dif-
ferent captions and menu items, depending on the regarding BIOS. In most cases
they are to be found under captions like USB, Boot and Legacy. In BIOS setup
you can also preset booting from USB firmly, usually under the menu item Boot.
Hint: You can enter the BBS menu directly when starting the PC with a
certain key on the keyboard, depending on the BIOS. In most cases the
startup screen shows which key to press. For the BBS menu it is îîF8îî
or îîF12îî in most cases, rarely îîF11îî. BIOS setup usually is
called with
the îîF2îî or îîDelîî key.
Starting the program  27
5  Program instructions
The following chapters give a detailed description on how to operate
HDShredder, from the start to the end.
Note: Depending on the edition you use, there may be differences in the
features described in this and the following chapters. Please check 41.4
Edition overview for the features your edition supports..
5.1  Preliminary steps
If you want to use USB devices for the following deletion process and your
edition
of
HDShredder
supports USB, connect these devices before starting
HDShredder
and leave them connected until the deletion process is finished. Otherwise it
is
not guaranteed that
HDShredder
recognizes them correctly. Do not use a USB
hub to connect USB storage devices, always connect the USB storage devices
directly to the USB controller or the PC case.
Note: HDShredder
can be started directly as a Windows application
(45.2.2 Windows program)
or as a self-booting application
(45.2.1 Self-
booting program).
To start the self-booting
HDShredder
,
you need a
bootable HDShredder CD or floppy disk. You can create it as described
in chapter
44.2.2 Boot-Setup & Emergency Medium.
5.2  Starting the program
5.2.1  Self-booting program
Insert the bootable HDShredder CD, floppy disk into the corresponding drive or
plug the bootable USB key to your PC. Switch on the computer or reboot it.
Make sure that the BIOS boots from the respective drive or USB key (44.4 Boot-
ing from USB key). HDShredder will then start automatically from the bootable
medium and the program screen appears.
Note: In case your PC does not boot from the HDShredder boot me-
dium, press îîF8îî, îîF11îî or îîF12îî (BIOS dependent)
immediately after
turning on the PC to enter the boot menu and select the HDShredder
boot device. Or press îîF2îî, îîF10îî or îîDelîî (BIOS
dependent) to enter
BIOS setup and set the required boot device order there.
28  Program instructions
5.2.2  Windows program
Start HDShredder from the Windows start menu at [Programme] â¸ [HDShred-
der]  â¸  [Start HDShredder] or by starting the executable file hdshredder.exe
from the genuine HDShredder medium or directly from your software package.
5.2.3  Command line program
You may include HDShredder in automated workflows like shell scripts or time-
triggered tasks. For this kind of usage, there is a command line version of
HDShredder (hdshredder-cl.exe), to be found in the program folder of
HDShredder. It is especially suitable for the following fields of application:
{
Calling it from shell scripts or batch files.
{
Creating a permanent link on the Desktop or in the Start menu.
{
Creating scheduled tasks by calling
HDShredder
through the Task Scheduler.
This allows to integrate HDShredder seamless into existing scripts or batch
pro-
cesses. You can also create Desktop links for frequently used deletion
configura-
tions to call them easy manually or automatically on demand. Usage of hdshred-
der-cl.exe is described in detail in 46.5 Command line interface.

5.6  Selecting the deletion area
On the first dialog page (4ï¬g.î7), you
can select the desired deletion area.
You can choose between the options
of deleting an entire drive and an indi-
vidual partition. The following table
provides you a short overview over
the available options. A detailed de-
scription of the usage of deletion ar-
eas and their effect can be found in
chapter 46 Operating principles.
Entire drive
Deletes all data on the selected drive.
(46.1.2 Deleting an entire drive)

vices and drives. If the recognition is not finished yet, a note will be
displayed
before the next dialog page will be shown. This can take up to one minute or
more. The time needed also depends on the number of drives connected. If it
takes more than five minutes, you can assume that there is a technical problem.
In this case you find further information in chapter 47 Troubleshooting.
5.7  Selecting the medium
In the two following steps, you select the medium for the deletion process. The
left half of the operating field shows a selection list. On the right side is
an info
box containing details on the currently selected element. According to the se-
lected deletion area, you can select either a drive or a partition. The
following
two sub-chapters give you more detailed information. After having selected the
medium, you come to 45.9 Selecting the options.

5.7.3  Deactivated list entries
There are two cases in which entries in the selection list for source or target
are
deactivated and therefore cannot be selected:
{
In the partition selection dialog, the hard disk list entries are always
deactivat-
ed because a partition but not a hard disk is to be selected.
{
If HDShredder recognizes drives which are not supported by the edition used
the partitions are also deactivated. For further information on the different
editions, please go to 41.4 Edition overview or http://www.hdshredder.com.
Hint: Activate All drives selectable
below the details to see the details
of drives which are recognized by HDShredder but not supported by
your edition
(41.4 Edition overview).
5.7.4  Drive information
On the right side of the selection list for drive or partition, you find a
frame contain-
ing details on the currently selected drive. When selecting a partition, the
data of
the corresponding drive is shown here. The following information is available
:
Field Description
Controller Type (IDE/SCSI) and number (0-15) of the controller
Channel/De-
vice
Channel used by the drive (primary/secondary) and
Connection of the drive (master/slave or 0-15)
LUN Logical number of the drive (0-255)
Name Name of the device (as specified by internal drive data)
Serial number Device serial number (as specified by internal drive data)
Manufacturer Name of the manufacturer (as specified by internal drive data)
Firmware Version of the firmware (as specified by internal drive data)
Supported Drive type supported by the edition used
Note: Supported will show Yes if the edition you use supports the se-
lected drive. Otherwise HDShredder indicates here from which edition
on that drive is supported.
5.7.5  Sector viewer
Under the Details window, there is a small symbol with a magnifier. A click on
this
symbol opens a window where you can view the content of the currently se-
lected medium in form of individual bytes. This particularly enables you to
make
a comparison between the data stored before and after the deletion process.
34  Program instructions
5.7.6  SpeedTest
Use the [SpeedTest] button in the lower right of the operating field to start a
speed test for the currently selected medium. Since this is a pure read test,
all
data will remain unchanged. The test shows the maximum speed that can be
achieved for linear reading on the currently selected medium
Note:
If the option
MultiDelete
(45.7.7 MultiDelete mode) is selected,
the speed measurement is being performed for all selected media at the
same time. Hence, it determines the maximum possible concurrent total
data throughput of these media. This is especially relevant for potential
use of the Enterprise Edition, but also represents a performance test of
the entire system. The speed that can be achieved strongly depends on
how the tested media are connected to the system (46.3.2 Speed).
5.7.7  MultiDelete mode
When selecting the medium to be deleted, you can use the checkbox
MultiDelete to activate MultiDelete mode (46.3 Mass deletion (MultiDelete
mode)). In this mode it is possible to select up to 16 drives or partitions for
dele-
tion at the same time. For doing so, click on all desired list entries. The
selected
entries then will be marked with a dark blue background. To remove a marked
list entry from the selection, it simply has to be clicked again. You can then
use
the SpeedTest (45.7.6 SpeedTest) to measure the data throughput of the se-
lected drives or partitions in parallel operation. Deleting multiple drives in
parallel
is only possible with the Enterprise Edition. It allows to delete up to 4, 8 or
16
targets at a time, depending on the stage used (Enterprise Edition 4x,
Enterprise
Edition 8x or Enterprise Edition 16x).
Note: The MultiDelete option can be activated in all editions of
HDShredder, even in the Free Edition. This can be used to check in ad-
vance which speed can be achieved on a certain system by using the
Enterprise Edition. Please keep in mind that the achievable speed in this
case strongly depends on the interfaces used (most suitable: IDE, SATA,
and SCSI) and the drive combinations (only use master drives with IDE).
5.8  Selecting the deletion method
The dialog page âDeletion methodâ provides different deletion methods to be
used for different areas of application. These procedures are grouped into
three
categories. The category Automatic allows you to perform a simple and secure
deletion fast and easily without needing any further detailed technical knowl-
edge except of the criteria of time and security. The category Standards is de-
Selecting the deletion method  35
signed for users required or wanting to fulfill certain deletion standards for
them-
selves or for their client. In the category Custom, you can define all details
of the
deletion method by yourself. Further information concerning the functions of
the different deletion methods can be found in 46.4 Deletion methods.
5.8.1  Automatic
Select the desired option:
{
Fast: One run within the shortest time possible gives you the security that no
one can view or recover your data with the help of normal means.
{
Medium: The best possible combination of security and time.
{
High security: Deletes data using an internationally recognized method which
is also considered to be secure against the data recovery in the laboratory.
By clicking [Next] at the right bottom of the dialog box, you confirm your
selec-
tion and come to the next step.
Note: If you want the highest security possible but you are not sure
whether the available time is sufficient, you can simply use the deletion
method High security. If running out of time, you can abort the process
at any time. This will not affect the deletion progress attained up to that
point of time negatively and you may achieve a higher level of security.
Example: You achieve a higher security aborting a High security (7 runs)
process after 4 runs than only using method Medium (3 runs), but let-
ting it run till the end.
5.8.2  Standards
Simply select the desired standard from the list displayed. By clicking [Next]
at
the lower right bottom of the dialog box, you confirm your selection and come
to the next step.
5.8.3  Custom
This category offers you a mask where you can define your specific deletion
method fast and easily. A specific deletion method is based on three parameters
and a repetition counter.
36  Program instructions
5.8.3.1  Deletion pattern
Enable or disable the parameters indi-
vidually (4ï¬g.î10), if necessary, using
the selection box at the respectively
left side of the parameter. Depending
on their activation, they will be taken
into account within the deletion pro-
cess. As default, only the upper pa-
rameter  Deletion pattern is enabled.
Define a deletion pattern as follows:
{
Deletion pattern: Here, you set the
pattern to be used for overwriting
the sectors. Please consider the fol-
lowing note.
{
Alternating pattern: If this parameter is enabled, the pattern indicated here
is
always written on the medium in a further run immediately after the pattern
specified under Deletion pattern.
{
Iteration(s): The value set here indicates how often the cycle consisting of
deletion pattern and alternating pattern is to be repeated.
{
Finalize with random values: After having executed all repetitions, a final run
with random numbers as a pattern can be carried out.
Note: A deletion pattern is entered as a hexadecimal 32-bit value. You
can also enter a 16- or 8- bit value. It will then be automatically con-
verted into a 32-bit value by repeating the entered value 2 or 4 times.
Example: The input mask converts 5Fh into 5F5F5F5Fh. On the right of
the input field, the entered value is displayed as a binary pattern.
5.8.3.2  Veriï¬cation
You can select the option Verify for the different deletion patterns and the
final
run. If this option is enabled, the respective deletion run is followed by a
verifica-
tion run to check whether the previously written patterns can be read from the
medium, i.e. it is verified whether the deletion pattern has actually been
written
on the medium.
5.9  Selecting the options
On the dialog page Options, you can set the options with which you want the
following deletion process to be executed. Principally, HDShredder automati-

5.10 Deleting data
The dialog page Delete data
(4ï¬g.î 12) lets you start the deletion
process. Check in the status field
whether the settings for deletion area,
medium, deletion method, and the se-
lected options are correct. If needed,
go back with [Back] in the lower left
corner and adjust the settings. Click
[Start] to start the deletion process.
5.10.1 Security query
Before the actual start of the deletion
process, a security query (4Abb.î13),
appears where the medium to be de-
leted as well as corresponding security
notes are displayed. Click [Start dele-
tion] to start the deletion process and
[Cancel] to return without starting the
deletion process.

Warning: All data in the target area will be irretrievably deleted by start-
ing the deletion process.
5.10.2 Deletion animation
In the center of the operating field, you see the deletion animation (if you
have
not deactivated it when selecting the options) after the start of the deletion
pro-
cess. The deletion animation shows that the deletion process is running. Espe-
cially in case the other indications only change marginally or do not change at
all
for a time (e.g. in case of read or write errors), the deletion animation shows
that
HDShredder is still running.
5.10.3 Status indication
On the left and right side of the operating field, you see the status
indicators.
They contain information on the current status of the deletion process.
Status Meaning
Sectors processed Absolute number of sectors already deleted.
Run Number of deletion runs started at this point.
Read errors Number of the read errors occurred. May decrease if
errors can be fixed. When starting the optional verifica-
tion run, this value is set back to zero.
Write errors Number of the write errors occurred. May decrease if
errors can be fixed. When starting the optional verifica-
tion run, this value is set back to zero.
Running time Time passed since the start of the deletion process.
Time remaining Estimated (!) time remaining for the entire deletion pro-
cess (incl. optional verification run) based on the deletion
speed attained up to here. Note: Duration can strongly
increase in case of occurring read or write errors.
Data rate Average data rate, which has been attained up to this
point of time. The indicated value refers to the amount
of deleted sectors.
Veriï¬cation errors This indicator is only used if the Verifying option is on.
5.10.4 Percentage indication
The percentage indicator (4ï¬g.î6) is located below the deletion animation,
show-
ing the progress of the current run (45.10.6 Course of the process) in percent.
40  Program instructions
5.10.5 Progress bar
The progress bar (4ï¬g.î6) below the percentage indication visualizes the
prog-
ress of the current run. Which run (45.10.6 Course of the process) is currently
processed is shown on the left above the progress bar.
5.10.6 Course of the process
The process consists of several runs, depending on the 46.4 Deletion methods
selected. First, a normal deletion run with an optional verification run. Each
dele-
tion run can be followed by a complementary run with inverted deletion pattern
as well as an optional verification run, too. This sequence can be repeated up
to
99 times. Depending on the deletion method, a final run with random numbers
as well as an optional verification run can be performed. The Custom mode thus
allows up to 398 runs. Additionally, a number of troubleshooting runs can
follow
with the option SmartDefectSkip (45.9.2 General options).
Note: This instruction uses the term deletion process to describe the
complete procedure with all corresponding runs (deletion, verification,
troubleshooting).
5.10.7 Interrupting the running process
You can use [Stop] at any time to in-
terrupt the process (4ï¬g.î 14 and
Abb.î15). You may then continue the
process ([Resume deleting] or [Con-
tinue verifying]) or abort it completely
([Abort deleting] or [Abort verifying],
45.11.1 User abort). As long as you
select neither option, the current process remains interrupted.
5.11 Termination of the deletion process
5.11.1 User abort
If you interrupt a running deletion pro-
cess or verification run by clicking
[Stop] (45.10.7 Interrupting the run-
ning process), you can definitively
abort the process in the dialog win-
dow which then appears (4ï¬g.î 14
ï¬g.î14: Abort dialog deletion process
Abb.î15: Abort dialog veriï¬cation run
Termination of the deletion process  41
and Abb.î15) by clicking [Abort deleting] or [Abort verifying]. You then
obtain a
final report (45.11.3 Final report) upon the prematurely terminated process.
Note: Activating the option SmartDefectSkip ensures that also in case
of a premature abortion of the deletion process the highest security
level possible at this point is achieved.
Example: If a deletion process with seven runs is aborted after the third
run, the security level of a deletion process with three runs is already
achieved at that point of time.
5.11.2 Regular termination
After finishing all runs (45.10.6 Course of the process) without a premature
abort, the deletion process is regularly ended. You then obtain a final report
upon the complete deletion process in a dialog window (45.11.3 Final report)
and a complete deletion report (45.11.4 Deletion report), if desired.
5.11.3 Final report
After termination (4ï¬g.î16) or the abort (4ï¬g.î17) of a deletion
process, you
obtain a final report in a dialog window with the following information:
{
The medium has been deleted completely: In case the deletion process has
been finished without an abort (even if sector errors occurred).
{
The deletion process has been aborted: In case the deletion process has
been aborted before its regular termination.
Furthermore, the final report contains the following information:
ï¬g.î16: Final report after a successful
deletion and veriï¬cation run
ï¬g.î17: Final report after the
abort of the deletion run

5.11.4 Deletion report
You can generate a deletion report
from the dialog window containing
the final report (45.11.3 Final report).
The deletion report contains a com-
plete and comprehensive description
of the previous deletion process and
can bes stored (4Abb.î18) as proof of
the completed deletion for the client,
for instance.
Click on [Create] to store
the deletion report to the selected me-
dium. The report will be written in the

44  Operating principles
6  Operating principles
HDShredder can handle both, entire drives and individual partitions.
Important: In case of doubt, you should always delete the entire me-
dium. Only if you are entirely sure that only a part, e.g. an individual
partition, is to be deleted, you should limit the area of deletion by se-
lecting the corresponding deletion area.
Hint: If you want to limit the area of deletion for reasons of time (e.g.
complex deletion method), but you are not entirely sure whether the
remaining areas are free of sensitive data, perform a simple deletion
(46.4.1.1 Fast â 1 run) of the entire medium at first. Afterwards, delete
the limited area with the desired and more complex deletion method.
6.1  Deletion area
Defining a deletion area with HDShredder allows you to determine exactly
which part of the medium is to be deleted. This has also influence on the time
required for deletion. It depends on the amount of the sectors to be deleted
and
the number of runs (according to the deletion method used, see 46.4 Deletion
methods). Despite using partitions, the deletion area can be defined even more
precisely, see 46.2 Deleting a sector area.
6.1.1  Physical deletion
In contrast to the normal deletion of files with the delete command or the
trash
or by formatting the medium, HDShredder does not only delete the file refer-
ences from the file directory (or the administration table) but also completely
overwrites the contents of files and directories. This also applies for files
which
have already been deleted in the conventional manner. However, any medium
or its sensitive areas should generally be overwritten once at least. This
prevents
the data thereon from being recovered using conventional data recovery soft-
ware.
Warning: After the physical deletion, the entire deleted data can only
be recovered with great technical expenditure â if possible at all â de-
pending on the deletion method used (see46.4 Deletion methods).
This also applies, of course, for an unintentional deletion. Before starting
the deletion process, please make sure you only delete the desired me-
dium. A recovery of the data â also in case of an unintentional dele-
Deletion area  45
tion â is generally impossible.
6.1.2  Deleting an entire drive
This deletion mode physically deletes an entire drive. Each sector
of the drive is overwritten once at least or even several times
with a certain deletion pattern, both according to the deletion
method selected (see 46.4 Deletion methods). After the suc-
cessful completion of the deletion process, all data and files pre-
viously stored on the drive are ultimately deleted, as well their
names as their contents.
Note: The physical deletion of entire drives overwrites
all sectors on the drive. This destroys actually all data on the drive, in-
cluding data which are not stored in files (e.g. hidden operating system
data, boot sector viruses, etc.). HDShredder also allows you to securely
delete proprietary file systems (e.g. of industrial or medical systems).
Deleting an entire drive is particularly useful for the following areas of
application
:
{
Secure deletion of drives with unknown data, e.g. as a service provider.
{
Deletion of data outside the file system (e.g. hidden system data, viruses,
etc.)
{
Secure deletion of proprietary file systems and hard disk formats (e.g. of
indus-
trial or medical systems).
6.1.3  Deleting a single partition
This deletion mode works quite similar to the previously de-
scribed mode (46.1.2 Deleting an entire drive). However, in this
case, only the contents of a single partition is physically deleted
and not the entire drive. The deletion is done by overwriting the
partition once or several times with a certain deletion pattern,
both depending on the deletion method selected (see 46.4 De-
letion methods).
This deletion area is particularly useful for the following areas of
application:
{
Secure deletion of single partitions containing sensitive data.
{
Selective deletion of partitions for further use of the remaining partitions.
{
Reducing time required for the deletion by limiting the area to be deleted.
{
Using different deletion methods for different partitions.

46  Operating principles
6.1.4  Automatic troubleshooting
HDShredder tries to troubleshoot occurring sector errors the best possible. If
this
is not possible, the errors will be counted in a corresponding error statistic.
6.1.5  Intensive reading/writing
In case of read or write errors,
HDShredder
uses different strategies in order to still
be able to read or write the data, if possible. The time used for defective
areas
depends to a large extent on the respective medium. According to the medium
and its state, several seconds up to minutes can be needed for repeated at-
tempts. Therefore, it is recommended to always activate the option
SmartDefectSkip (45.9.2 General options) it postpones handling of defective
sectors until deletion of all intact areas has been finished. The process can
be
aborted if it takes too long, without exposing the data in the intact areas.
6.1.6  Read errors
During the deletion process, read errors can only occur in a verification run.
HDShredder then tries to read the defective areas immediately after termination
of the run (option SmartDefectSkip,  45.9.2 General options) within a single
troubleshooting run (45.10.6 Course of the process), using special access
strat-
egies. During the troubleshooting run, the number of the indicated errors can
reduce according to the areas on the medium, which could be finally accessed.
Note: Read errors occurring during verification are counted as verifica-
tion errors (45.10.3 Status indication).
6.1.7  Write errors
Write errors can only occur during a deletion run. HDShredder then tries to
write
the defective areas immediately after termination of the deletion run (option
SmartDefectSkip, 45.9.2 General options) within a proper troubleshooting run
(45.10.6 Course of the process), using special access strategies. During the
er-
ror recovery run, the number of the indicated write errors can decrease de-
pending on the recoverable areas on the medium.
6.1.8  Veriï¬cation errors
If the selected deletion method contains verification runs, HDShredder executes
verification runs (45.10.6 Course of the process) a in addition to the deletion
process. A verification error is counted if the data read does not match the
previ-
Mass deletion (MultiDelete mode)  47
ously written pattern. Furthermore, read errors, which occur during the
verifica-
tion run, are also counted as verification errors. Therefore, the number of
verifi-
cation errors gives you absolute information on the amount of sectors where
secure deletion could not be confirmed.
6.2  Deleting a sector area
In case of an area deletion, the medium is not used as a whole. Only a partial
area of the selected medium (drive or partition) is used for the deletion.
6.2.1  Usage
The dialog page Options provides the possibility to specify an exactly
definable
sector area (45.9.3 Options for the medium). To specify a sector area, activate
the check box Sector area and enter the starting (from) and the ending (to)
sec-
tor of the area to define. These sectors are interpreted as the first and the
last
sector of the are, i.e. they are included with the area.
Note: Counting starts with â0â (= 1st sector of the medium), so all further
sector numbers have to be decreased by 1 (e.g. fromî=î0, toî=î99999
defines the first 100000 sectors on the medium as an area).
Warning: Only use an area deletion if you are completely aware of its
functioning. A sector area, which has not been defined properly, may
lead to undeleted data remaining on the medium.
6.2.2  Functioning
The sector area is always subordinated to the selected medium (drive or parti-
tion) and is interpreted relatively to the starting position of the medium.
Instead
of using the whole medium for the subsequent deletion process, only the de-
fined sector area will be used. Compared to a normal deletion, the only differ-
ence is that instead of deleting the whole drive or partition only the defined
partial area is being deleted.
Example: Sector area fromî=î0, toî=î31. For drives this defines the
(ab-
solute) first 32 sectors. The absolute position of the first 32 sectors of a
partition depends on its (absolute) start on the drive.
6.3  Mass deletion (MultiDelete mode)
In case of a mass deletion, multiple target media are being deleted at the same
time. As a result there is a huge benefit regarding time and performance, since
multiple media can be deleted at the same time.
48  Operating principles
6.3.1  Mode of operation
A mass deletion generally works the same way as a single deletion. A soon as
the
option MultiDelete has been selected on the medium selection dialog (45.7
Selecting the medium), two or more media can be selected in the list. The re-
maining steps are just the same as when deleting a single medium.
Note: When performing a mass deletion, the result on each medium is
identical with the result of a single deletion â and equally secure.
6.3.2  Speed
Mass deletion yields an enormous advantage in speed compared to single dele-
tions. In case of optimal connected media (46.3.3 Different media) , peed in-
creases straight proportional with the number of media. For example, a fourfold
deletion yields about four times the data throughput of a single deletion.
6.3.3  Different media
MultiDelete can be used with an arbitrary combination of drive types. Differ-
ences in performance of different media types may have an impact on the total
performance. It is recommended to use IDE drives configured as master only.
6.4  Deletion methods
HDShredder offers different deletion methods, applicable for different areas of
use. They are grouped into three categories.
6.4.1  Automatic
This category is designed for a simple and secure deletion. It allows you to
start
the deletion procedure fast and easily without further detailed technical
knowl-
edge simply according to the criteria of time and security. The category there-
fore provides three deletion methods.
6.4.1.1  Fast â 1 run
This deletion method offers the highest possible deletion speed with one run
only. This method already prevents the data from being easily readout or recov-
ered with conventional data recovery software
Deletion methods  49
6.4.1.2  Medium â 3 runs
For technical reasons, the security against recovering the data in a laboratory
in-
creases with the number of deletion passes performed. This deletion method
combines high security with a reasonable duration of the deletion process.
6.4.1.3  High security â 7 runs
This deletion method provides internationally approved security against recov-
ering deleted data â even in a special data recovery laboratory. That is why
its 7
runs require a certain period of time to perform the deletion.
6.4.2  Standards
This category allows you to perform the deletion according to an international
standard. This category is particularly designed for users having to or wanting
to
fulfil a certain deletion standard for themselves or for their clients. Select
the de-
sired standard and the deletion will be performed compliant to that standard.

6.4.3  Custom
This category allows you to define the deletion method in all details (45.8.3
Custom). Only few steps are necessary to define your own deletion method in
order to customize the deletion to your individual requirements.
6.5  Command line interface
To integrate HDShredder into automated processes or to enable it for time-trig-
gered calls, there is the additional file hdshredder-cl.bat for calling
HDShredder
from the Windows command line. This program is destined for being called by
batch and shell scripts or program links. It handles user input and output
exclu-
sively via the command line and calling parameters.
This allows to use the command line version for areas of application, for which
the graphical version is not suitable, like the following examples:
{
Time-triggered calling: Scheduled calls of HDShredder by the Windows Task
Manager to start frequent or periodic deletion processes automatically.
52  Operating principles
{
Script integration: Calling HDShredder from scripts for integrating it into
auto-
mated processes.
{
Programmed processes: For recurring deletion processes, you can create links
in the Start Menu, the Quick Launch bar, or on the Desktop to allow these pro-
grammed processes to be called quickly and easily at any time.
Hint: When calling hdshredder-cl -help or without any parameters, a list
of supported parameters in combination with a short description of
their usage will be displayed.
The following chapters list and explain the supported parameters. The order of
individual parameters when calling hdshredder-cl is arbitrary.
6.5.1  Start Menu
To facilitate use of the command line version, it has its own Start Menu entry.
At
the HDShredder entry, you find the sub-folder CLI. It contains two subitems:
{
HDShredder CLI: Opens a privileged Windows Shell in the program folder, so
you can directly start the command line version from here.
{
Scripting templates: Opens a folder with templates for batch scripts in the
Windows Explorer. You may customize them according to your needs.
Important: Along the scripting templates, there is an hdshredder-cl.bat
file. Use it instead of hdshredder.exe cl, especially in complex scripts, to
ensure you obtain the correct result values (46.5.6 Return values).
6.5.2  Program call
The command line version of HDShredder expects the following calling syntax:
{
Deleting an entire drive
hdshredder-cl -mode:d -drv:[drvid] -method:[methodname]
{
Deleting a single partition
hdshredder-cl -mode:p -vol:[drvletter] -method:[methodname]
Note: When using Enterprise Edition with more than one deletion tar-
get, the calling syntax is extended as follows: the parameter combina-
tions -drv:[drvid] (drive) or -vol:[drvletter] (partition/volume) have to
be specified iteratively, one for each deletion target.
Providing the parameters described above is mandatory. If one of the parame-
ters is missing or has an invalid value, the call will be canceled with an
error
Command line interface  53
6.5.3  Drive identiï¬cation
To allow more areas of use for physical drives (-drv:[drvid]), there are
different
ways to specify a drive:
{
Drive by Windows ID: Physical drives are usually specified by their respective
ID, assigned by Windows at run-time. This ID is to be found in the Disk Man-
agement of Windows (diskmgmt.msc).
{
Drive by port: You can also specify the port that is used to connect the drive
(not for USB and Firewire). If you specify the 2nd SATA port for the source,
the
drive connected to it will be used, regardless of the Windows ID assigned to
it.
{
Drive by name / serial number: Alternatively, a drive can be selected by its
type name and /or serial number, regardless of the Windows ID assigned to it
or over which port it is connected. But it has to be unique in the context of
the
deletion to be performed (and the Edition used).
Hint: You can use hdshredder-cl -list to display a list of the available
physical drives and their respective indications: Windows ID, port num-
ber, and name/serial number.
In case there are several media available under the identification provided,
HDShredder Enterprise Edition will take this specification as unambiguous if
the
number of drives is smaller than or equal to the maximal allowed number.
Example: If you specify a drive name as medium, which matches five
drives in the system, HDShredder Enterprise Edition 8x will use all five
drives as deletion targets, while the Enterprise Edition 4x will refuse de-
leting due to the ambiguity.
Note: If HDShredder cannot make an unambiguous selection for the
port or identification specified, HDShredder will abort the process with
an error.
6.5.4  Deletion methods
Parameter -method:[methodname] is used to select the deletion method used.
The command line version (CLI) offers the same methods as the graphical ver-
sion (45.8 Selecting the deletion method). The command line version accepts
the following values for [methodname].

7  Troubleshooting
This paragraph describes possible problems when using HDShredder and offers
proposals for solution. If there should be no proposal for solution for a
problem,
you can gladly contact our 48.5 Support.
7.1  Load errors
During the start of the program, before HDShredder is loaded itself, a message
and a progress bar will appear on the boot screen. In case of an error, one of
the
following error codes will be indicated here.
7.1.1  Error #5002 and âDisk errorâ
This error will be displayed if the boot medium is not readable when booting
the
program. The error is reported by the BIOS of the computer and points to a de-
fective data carrier or a problem with the used boot drive. In many cases, in
par-
ticular when booting from a floppy disk, an incompatibility between drive and
data carrier is the cause. Principally this problem can be fixed. Please try
the fol-
lowing steps, at best in the indicated order:
{
Try again to boot the program, perhaps with/without cold start.
{
Create once again a bootable disk (44 Installation).
{
Floppy disk:
Format the Floppy disk (no quick format) before creating a new one.
{
Floppy disk: Use another floppy disk.
{
Use (if possible) another boot drive.
Note: If you didnât receive HDShredder as an installation package but
on a bootable disk and if a disk shows this problems also after multiple
trials on different devices, please contact our Support (48.5 Support)
and indicate your license number.
7.1.2  Other errors
If other errors in the form of # (number) should occur when loading the
program,
please contact our 48.5 Support.
7.2  Keyboard and mouse
HDShredder supports keyboards and mice with PS/2 standard or USB connector
58 Troubleshooting
(43 Supported hardware). This also includes many wireless mice, given they are
connected as a true USB device. Input devices connected with Bluetooth are
currently not supported. In this case, please connect a separate USB device. If
keyboard or mouse (or both) do not function with HDShredder, this is usually
due to a wrong legacy emulation setting in BIOS setup. On most computers, you
can fix this problem by changing (activating or deactivating, depending on the
current setting) the emulation for PS/2 devices in BIOS setup. Please consult
your
computer manual on how to change this setting since it may be named differ-
ently according to the respective BIOS. In most of the cases, you can find it
un-
der the name USB Legacy Support or USB Keyboard Support (often under
Integrated Peripherals or Advanced Options).
Note: In some of the cases, problems with PS/2 keyboards or mice oc-
cur with active emulation for PS/2 devices. If you donât use any USB de-
vices, please switch off PS/2 emulation in the BIOS setup.
7.3  General problems
7.3.1  Slowed down system
If you think the speed of the total system or the deletion speed â also with
IDE
and SCSI devices â is too slow, a USB controller can be the cause, even if it
is not
used (47.6.4 Speed loss).
7.3.2  Read, write and veriï¬cation errors
If HDShredder reports errors, these are usually defective areas on the
respective
medium. However, general problems with the hardware can possibly also cause
(putative) read and write errors. This is mostly noticeable by a very high
number
of displayed errors. First of all, try to fix the problem via the help
instructions for
the respective hardware types (IDE, SCSI, USB) because the causes are usually
found there. If the problems cannot be fixed this way either, deactivate step
by
step the following options, at best in the indicated order:
{
CachedMemory
{
Read cache and write cache
{
DMA
{
SharedMemory
If the problem does not occur any more after having deactivated a certain op-
tion, the previously deactivated options can be reactivated as a test.
IDE/ATA/SATA 59
7.4  IDE/ATA/SATA
7.4.1  Hard disk not recognized
If HDShredder does not recognize a hard disk, there can be several reasons.
Per-
haps the controller, which the disk is connected to, has not been found (47.4.2
IDE controller not found). A further possible reason can be a non-standardly
connected hard disk. This is for example the case if a hard disk is configured
as
slave and if a CD/DVD drive or no drive at all is connected at the same IDE
chan-
nel as master. Normally, HDShredder can handle that, too.
Note: If an SATA hard disk is not recognized, this can also be due to the
used SATA controller (43.3.2 SATA/SATA-II controllers
).
7.4.2  IDE controller not found
There are the following three reasons why HDShredder has not automatically
recognized an IDE controller:
{
The IDE controller/channel is deactivated, e.g. on an onboard IDE controller.
Activate the IDE controller/channel via the BIOS setup.
{
Standard IDE controllers (ISA) are not taken into account if PCI IDE
controllers
are available. Connect the respective hard disk to a PCI IDE controller in this
case or deactivate the PCI IDE controller or controllers.
{
The used controller does not correspond to the PCI IDE standard. Although
most controllers support this standardized programming interface, there are
some controllers which have only a proprietary programming interface. More
detailed information can be found in43.3.1 IDE/ATA controllers. Connect the
corresponding drives to another controller (PCI IDE controller).
7.4.3  Problems with DMA
The following principal problems can occur with (Ultra) DMA:
{
The achieved speed is too slow despite DMA. Please consider that the achiev-
able speed (43.3.5 Speed) depends on many factors and that this is not ab-
solutely due to a problem with DMA.
{
DMA mode is not available. When selecting the options (45.9.3 Options for
the medium), the option DMA is deactivated and locked in this case.
{
Read, write or verification errors occur when using DMA.
60 Troubleshooting
In all cases, the problems can be due to the same reasons. When having prob-
lems with DMA, you can principally use PIO mode at any time. Deactivate the
option DMA of the concerned drive when selecting the options (45.9.3 Op-
tions for the medium). Since PIO mode is usually much slower than DMA, we
recommend to try first of all the following hints and help instructions to
possibly
be able to use the DMA mode. Please consider the notes in the subchapter
47.4.4 BIOS settings.
{
Check if the concerned drive really supports DMA. Some older drives and es-
pecially older CompactFlash media do not support DMA.
{
Make sure that from Ultra DMA Mode 3 on an 80-wire data cable is used to
connect the drive(s).
{
If two drives are connected via the same cable, the DMA mode of the slower
drive is also used for the faster drive. Remove the slower drive temporarily,
if
possible, or connect the drives via separate channels or cables.
{
Try both connections of the data cable (center connection and connection at
the end) in case of a single connected drive to eliminate possible problems
with damping (center connection) and reflection (connection at the end).
{
Switch the used UltraDMA mode to a lower value in the BIOS setup (47.4.4.1
Switch to a lower/higher UltraDMA mode) or deactivate UltraDMA (47.4.4.2
Activate/deactivate UltraDMA). Multiword DMA mode will be (automatically)
still available, which offers about a twice to four times higher speed than PIO
mode.
{
On the other hand, you can also try to activate UltraDMA or to switch to a
higher UltraDMA mode if the corresponding default settings in your BIOS set-
up are too low.
Note: Our tests revealed that some chipsets and hard disks do not col-
laborate optimally. This can lead to UltraDMA mode (putatively cor-
rectly) recognized and set in the BIOS is too high.
7.4.4  BIOS settings
In case of problems when using DMA, please refer to the following notes:
The following notes refer to settings which you should possibly make in the
BIOS
setup of your computer if problems occur during the use of DMA. Since the set-
tings in the BIOS setup are manufacturer- and model-specific, these notes can
only be given in a general form. Refer to your BIOS manual on how exactly to
make these settings and which settings are available at all. You usually find
the
DMA settings under Integrated Peripherals or Chipset Setup in the BIOS setup.
SCSI 61
Note: Please perform automatic hard disk recognition in BIOS after each
modification of the DMA and hard disk settings so that the modifica-
tions for the corresponding drives become effective. Make sure to save
the modifications via Save and Exit when leaving BIOS setup.
7.4.4.1  Switch to a lower/higher UltraDMA mode
In many BIOS setups the (highest) used UltraDMA mode can be selected manu-
ally. If you have problems with DMA, try to switch the used mode step by step
to a lower level at the corresponding IDE channel. Only if this does not solve
the
problem, deactivate UltraDMA completely. The controller then mostly (auto-
matically) uses multi-word DMA, which is at least faster than PIO. You can
switch
the UltraDMA mode step by step to a higher level, if you think you have not se-
lected the best possible UltraDMA mode.
7.4.4.2  Activate/deactivate UltraDMA
Some BIOS setups do not offer a free selection of the UltraDMA mode but only
an automatic recognition or deactivation. If this is the case with your BIOS or
if
you have already switched to the lowest UltraDMA mode and problems keep
occurring, deactivate UltraDMA. Usually, multi-word DMA is (automatically)
available then, which is often faster than PIO. Only if this doesnât function
either,
you should completely switch off the DMA mode in HDShredder (45.9.3 Op-
tions for the medium). If UltraDMA is deactivated in your BIOS setup, you can
activate it as a test, of course, in order to attain a higher speed, if
possible.
7.4.4.3  Deactivate IO caching
If there are problems in the PIO mode as well, you should deactivate IO caches
and buffers. In particular the setting Dataport Postwrite, if available, should
be
switched to Disable if there are problems.
7.4.4.4  Set BIOS defaults
If HDShredder should not work as desired despite all the above mentioned in-
structions, you can try to set standard values via the option Load BIOS/Setup
Defaults. This setting tries to avoid possible hardware conflicts.
7.5  SCSI
When using SCSI devices, please make sure that they are correctly configured
and connected to the SCSI controller. In particular SCSI controllers with SCSI
BIOS
62 Troubleshooting
must show a hard disk during the system start, so that HDShredder can then ad-
dress this hard disk. Furthermore, HDShredder must support the controller you
use. You find a list of the supported SCSI controllers in chapter 43.4.2
Compat-
ibility.
Note: Even if an SCSI controller shows the desired drives during the sys-
tem start, this is no guarantee that they are correctly configured or con-
nected. In principle, the BIOS of the SCSI controller works on a lower
level than the SCSI drivers used by HDShredder and can possibly recog-
nize hard disk drives which are not recognized by HDShredder itself.
HDShredder has been tested on a range of SCSI controllers. Sporadically en-
countered problems are bypassed by the software as far as possible. The follow-
ing subchapters contain useful hints on how to solve further random or sporadic
problems. These hints should be applied in the described order to minimize the
effort, if possible. The following problems occurred during the tests and could
be
bypassed with the hints from the following subchapters:
{
HDShredder
stops during device recognition (45.6 Selecting the deletion area).
{
No SCSI hard disks are recognized.
{
Not all SCSI hard disks are recognized.
7.5.1  Restart
If HDShredder stops during the startup or does not show the desired SCSI
drives,
try to restart with a warm boot (reset button). Only if this does not fix the
prob-
lem, you should try a cold start (switch off the PC and switch it on again
after 30
seconds). Both forms of restart may solve signal problems of SCSI controllers.
7.5.2  Deactivate unused controllers
If a restart does not lead to the desired result, you should, if your system
dispos-
es of several SCSI controllers, deactivate unused controllers. This is also
recom-
mended if a controller is principally used, but the hard disks connected to it
are
not needed for using HDShredder.
7.5.3  Deactivate unused drives
In some cases, SCSI hard disks, which are connected to the same controller, can
interfere with each other or even with the controller itself. Deactivate
individual
hard disks as a test or connect them step by step after one another to find out
which hard disk possibly causes an interference. Make sure that the last SCSI
de-
vice is always terminated also during the tests.
USB 63
7.5.4  Minimum conï¬guration of the controller
The configuration of the SCSI controller over its BIOS setup or the BIOS setup
of
the PC, in case of onboard controllers, can also solve the problem. Set the
lowest
resp. the securest values for the SCSI bus (e.g. transmission in the narrow
mode
of a wide controller).
7.5.5  Minimum conï¬guration of the systems
Try to connect the SCSI hard disks used in the system in a different way, espe-
cially if you use several SCSI controllers. Proceed as follows, if possible:
deacti-
vate all SCSI controllers except one. This controller should have one SCSI
chan-
nel only, if possible, and be part of the controllers listed in43.4.3
Manufacturer
information. Connect then the needed drive or drives only. Apart from defective
drives, this strategy mostly allowed us to find a functioning configuration
during
our tests to execute the planned job.
7.6  USB
Despite the vast support of USB controllers and storage devices (43.5 USB),
there are some cases where these controllers and devices do not function as
expected. The following subchapters provide you with hints and solutions.
7.6.1  Storage device not recognized
Mostly, there are four possible reasons why a USB storage device supported by
HDShredder (43.1 Overview) is not recognized:
{
The USB storage device has been connected too late or exchanged after-
wards. USB storage devices should be connected to the computer before
starting HDShredder (45.1 Preliminary steps).
{
The USB storage device is not directly connected to the USB controller but via
a hub (e.g. at the monitor). Always connect the USB devices, you wish to use
with HDShredder, directly to the USB controller or to the computer.
{
The used device is no standard-conform USB mass storage device and does
there-fore not belong to the supported devices (43.5.1 Mass-Storage-Class).
{
The USB storage device is defective or works faultily. You should then test its
functionality by using it with another PC or another operating system.
Note: If no USB storage device is recognized and if the above men-
tioned possibilities are excluded, the corresponding USB controller has
probably not been recognized (47.6.3 Controller not found).
64 Troubleshooting
7.6.2  Other device problems
Some devices, especially USB sticks, can show malfunctions in case of tempera-
ture rise or continuous operation, i.e. in case of continuous reading or
writing big
amounts of data. With HDShredder, these problems manifest in read or write er-
rors on the respective USB storage device, which do not always occur at the
same location but after a certain operating time. Sometimes these hardware
problems also lead to very long breaks during the deletion process, which can
be
up to several minutes. When selecting the options (45.9.2 General options),
deactivate the option SharedMemory in this case. Only if the problem persists,
activate additionally the option Cooling break (45.9.2 General options) for the
concerned device. The deletion process then takes a bit longer, but in most of
the cases the data transfer functions better.
Note: The described problems are mostly due to deficient hardware
and also occur under other operating systems. We recommend you to
have the concerned device replaced by your vendor.
7.6.3  Controller not found
HDShredder should recognize all current USB controllers which offer one of the
USB standard interfaces (43.5.2 UHCI, OHCI and EHCI). If HDShredder recog-
nizes USB devices on one PC but not on another PC or on another controller, the
USB controller can have one of the following problem:
{
The USB controller does not meet to the UHCI, OHCI or EHCI standard. In this
case, use another compatible (43.5.2 UHCI, OHCI and EHCI) USB controller.
{
The USB controller is deactivated, e.g. in case of an onboard USB controller.
Activate the USB controller via the BIOS setup.
{
The USB controller does not function correctly or is defective. Use another
USB controller or another PC for the deletion process.
7.6.4  Speed loss
USB controllers can have a negative effect on the speed of the whole system.
This particularly affects the deletion speed of all device types (also IDE and
SCSI), even if no USB storage device is connected. Remove or deactivate the
corresponding USB controller if it is not needed during the use of HDShredder.
Otherwise, there are no negative effects apart from the speed loss.
Note: In our tests, this problem showed up with one USB controller (VIA
VT6212) and could be reproduced with different computers and oper-
ating systems. The speed loss on the PCI bus was at about 40% (!).
Mapped network drives  65
7.6.5  Other controller problems
Another problem is an incompatibility with certain USB storage devices caused
by the USB controller. Especially older USB devices do not function flawlessly
in
such USB controllers. Use another USB controller, if possible.
Note: In our tests, this problem showed up with only one USB controller
(Acer ALi M5273) and was also reproducible on other computers and
operating systems.
7.7  Mapped network drives
When using mapped drives in Windows, HDShredder may not find the mapped
drives in some cases, since HDShredder is running in administrator mode. To use
the established mapped drives, a small change to the Windows Registry is re-
quired. Usually,44.2.1 HDShredder Setup) will handle this automatically. But
you
can also make the change manually, as described below:
{
Open the registry editor (regedit.exe)
{
Move to the following registry key in the tree structure
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
Policies\System
{
Create the DWORD value EnableLinkedConnections
{
Set its value data to 1 and restart your computer.
Note: To undo the changes, simply delete the registry value.

8.1  Terms of license
HDShredder is designed to offer you the highest possible technical flexibility,
and
also the HDShredder license conditions are designed not to limit your
flexibility
when using HDShredder. Since you usually donât know at the beginning on how
many computers and how often you will use the software, we offer you a very
simple and cost-effective license model, which restricts you the least
possible.
8.1.1  License model
The following table shows you the minimum number of licenses necessary for
the respective area of use.

3)
  Technicians are all employees who use HDShredder simultaneously or for field
service.
4)
  PC which is exclusively used for HDShredder, for example as a deletion
server.
In practice, the use of HDShredder can involve a different number of PCs ac-
cording to the area of use. Either the program is permanently used on one
single
computer, which the media to be deleted is connected to when needed (dedi-
cated PC). Or HDShredder is always used directly on the respective computers,
Certificate of authenticity  67
which the media to be deleted is already connected to; mostly with only one
usage per computer. To find a fair regulation for all use cases, you can choose
between a license per dedicated PC and a license for a lump number of work
station PCs where HDShredder will be used on. Furthermore, you need addi-
tional licenses if you use HDShredder (potentially) in parallel on several PCs,
e.g.
if several service employees use HDShredder independently from each other.
That is why you need at least one license per branch office because this also
represents a (potential) parallel use.
8.1.2  Examples
The following examples refer to frequently occurring license situations:
{
A company with 50 PC work stations needs two licenses of the Professional
Edition, whereof each covers 25 PC work stations.
{
A company with 100 PC work stations needs four licenses of the Professional
Edition, one for 25 PCs each.
{
A service provider with two PCs that serve as HDShredder deletion stations
needs two licenses of the Professional Edition, one for each deletion station.
{
A service provider with two field service employees who use HDShredder
needs two licenses of the Professional Edition, one for each independently
working technician.
8.1.3  Scope
A license is unlimited concerning the number of usages and the period of valid-
ity. It can be used as often as desired and without a time limit. However, the
li-
cense is limited with regard to the (also potentially) parallel use on several
com-
puters and the size of the company or the institution concerning the number of
existing PC work stations.
8.1.4  Consultancy

The following notes exclusively refer to the boxed versions of HDShredder and
not to the versions available as download or via email.
68 Miscellaneous
8.2.1  Security hologram
For the protection against bootleg copies, our software is equipped with a
secu-
rity hologram, among others. Each of the original data carriers you received
bears a security hologram. Please keep the data carriers with the security
holo-
gram in any case because this is your license proof.
8.2.2  Valid product license
The condition to have a valid product license is that the number printed on the
security hologram corresponds to the number shown within the program. If this
should not be the case for your software package, please email us at products@
miray.de. Please indicate the number displayed by the program, the number on
the security hologram and where you acquired the software package. If there is
no security hologram on the data carriers or if the security hologram is
damaged,
please contact us as well and indicate the above mentioned data. We will try to
find a simple solution so that you obtain a valid license.
Note: Make sure that each data carrier you received bears its own se-
curity hologram with its own registration number and that this number
has to correspond to the number of the program which has been start-
ed from this data carrier. That means if you start the program from a
floppy disk, the displayed number has to correspond to the number of
the security hologram on the floppy disk and not to the number of the
security hologram on the CD.
