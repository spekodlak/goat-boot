MENU LABEL CPU Burn-in V1.00
TEXT HELP
 Included in CPUstress. Heats up any x86 CPU to the maximum possible operating
 temperature that is achievable by using ordinary software. This allows the
 user to adjust the CPU speed up to the practical maximum while still being
 sure that stability is achieved even under the most stressful conditions.

MENU LABEL Intel Optimized LINPACK Benchmark V11.2.0
TEXT HELP
 Included in CPUstress. A generalization of the LINPACK 1000 benchmark. Solves
 a dense (real*8) system of linear equations (Ax=b), measures the amount of
 time it takes to factor and solve the system, converts that time into a
 performance rate, and tests the results for accuracy.
